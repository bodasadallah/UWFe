Error_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Correct_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Prediction: 1. the error is the use of the singular form "qualified" which implies only one qualified human resource, whereas the correct sentence requires the plural form "qualified human resources" to indicate multiple individuals who are qualified.
2. the error is the use of the singular form "resource" which implies only one resource, whereas the correct sentence requires the plural form "resources" to indicate multiple elements of human capital available for use.

Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

Error_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .

Correct_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .

Prediction: the error here is using "polices" instead of "police." the word "police" is a singular noun, so it should not have an "s" at the end.

2. error: hoaxes spreading, correction: hoaxes from spreading 
explanations: 
the error here is using "hoaxes spreading" instead of "hoaxes from spreading." the preposition "from" is needed to show the action of preventing something.

Label: 1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".


------------------------------


Error_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .

Correct_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .

Prediction: 1. the error "of" should be corrected to "on" to show the correct preposition usage in this context.
2. the error with the extra "the" before "social media" makes the sentence grammatically incorrect, leading to incorrect article usage.

Label: 1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

Error_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement .

Correct_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to high-velocity technological advancement .

Prediction: the article "the" should be removed before the word "study" because in this context, "study in the genetic field" is a general concept and does not require a definite article.

Label: 1. The concept of "technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific advancement instead of the progress of technology in general.


------------------------------


Error_sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .

Correct_sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .

Prediction: 1. "the" is incorrect because it does not add any meaning to the sentence and can be omitted. "however" is used to introduce a contrasting point or idea.
2. "using" is incorrect because the sentence is referring to the act of people using something, so the present tense verb "use" should be used instead.
3. "over" is incorrect because it does not make sense in this context. the correct preposition to use when talking about influence or control is "on."
4. "on" is incorrect because it should be "over" to show that people will have power and control over us.

Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.

Error_sentence: Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .

Correct_sentence: Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .

Prediction: the error is in subject-verb agreement. since "social media" is a singular noun, the verb should be "does" instead of "do."

2. error: missing comma before "and"
explanations: the error is a missing comma before the conjunction "and" when separating items in a list.

Label: 1. The subject here is "social media," which is collective and treated as singular, so the verb should be "does" for subject verb agreement.


------------------------------


Error_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .

Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .

Prediction: 1. the error is the unnecessary use of "the" before "importance." "the" is only needed if the noun it refers to is specific or has already been mentioned.
2. the error is using "contacts" instead of "contact." "contact" in this context refers to interpersonal communication or interaction, while "contacts" refers to a list of people or organizations to connect with.

Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.

Error_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .

Correct_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .

Prediction: the verb "claimed" should be changed to "claim" to match the verb tense of the sentence and maintain consistency.
2. error: there are no other errors in this sentence.

Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.


------------------------------


Error_sentence: Human has their own rights and privacy .

Correct_sentence: Humans have their own rights and privacy .

Prediction: 1. error: "human" should be changed to "humans" to indicate plural agreement.
2. error: "has" should be changed to "have" to match the subject "humans" in number.

Label: 1. The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".

Error_sentence: This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .

Correct_sentence: This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both at high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .

Prediction: 1. error: "has", correction: "have"
explanation: the subject "both of his parents" is plural, so the verb should also be in plural form ("have" instead of "has").

2. error: "under", correction: "at"
explanation: the correct preposition to use with "high risk" is "at" rather than "under".

3. error: "under", correction: "at"
explanation: the correct preposition to use with "high risk" is "at" rather than "under".

4. error: "runing", correction: "running"
explanation: the correct spelling of the word is "running", with double "n".

Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.
