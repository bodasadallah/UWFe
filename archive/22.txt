Error_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Correct_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: qualified, Correction: 

The error is the use of the adjective "qualified" to describe the noun "human resource". In this context, "qualified" is not necessary and actually makes the sentence sound awkward. The correct correction is to remove the adjective "qualified" and simply use the noun "human resources", which is a common phrase in English to refer to a group of people with a particular skill or expertise.

2. Error: resource, Correction: resources

The error is the use of the singular noun "resource" instead of the plural noun "resources". In this sentence, "human resources" is a plural noun phrase that refers to a group of people, so the correct correction is to use the plural form "resources" instead of the singular form "resource".

Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

Error_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .

Correct_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .

Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

1. Error: "polices" instead of "police"
Explanation: The error is a plural form mistake. The correct word is "police", which is a singular noun referring to a law enforcement agency or officer. The plural form of "police" would be "police officers", but in this context, the singular form "police" is used to refer to a single entity.

Label: 1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".


------------------------------


Error_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .

Correct_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "of" instead of "on"
Explanation: The error is due to the misuse of prepositions. "Of" is used to indicate possession or origin, whereas "on" is used to indicate a relationship or dependence. In this sentence, "on" is the correct preposition to use because it indicates the society's reliance on social media and the Internet, rather than possessing or originating from it.

2. Error: extra "the" instead of nothing
Explanation: The error is due to unnecessary repetition. The sentence already has one "the" before "social media and the Internet", so adding another one is redundant and incorrect. The correct sentence only needs one "the" to indicate the specific social media and Internet being referred to.

Label: 1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

Error_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement .

Correct_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to high-velocity technological advancement .

Prediction: Based on the given information, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.

Error 1: the, Correction: 

Explanation: The error is the presence of an unnecessary article "the" before the phrase "high-velocity technological advancement". The correct sentence removes this article, making the sentence more concise and grammatically correct.

Label: 1. The concept of "technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific advancement instead of the progress of technology in general.

Error_sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .

Correct_sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: The, Correction: However,

The error is a misplaced article. The original sentence starts with "The" which is not a suitable conjunction to begin a sentence. The correction "However" is a more suitable conjunction to start a sentence, indicating a contrast or a change in direction.

2. Error: using, Correction: use

The error is a verb tense inconsistency. The verb "using" is in the present participle form, which doesn't match the rest of the sentence. The correction "use" is in the base form, which is more suitable in this context, indicating a general or habitual action.

3. Error: over, Correction: on

The error is a preposition mismatch. The preposition "over" is not suitable in this context, as it implies a sense of dominance or control. The correction "on" is more suitable, indicating a sense of reliance or dependence.

4. Error: on, Correction: over

The error is a preposition mismatch. The preposition "on" is not suitable in this context, as it implies a sense of reliance or dependence. The correction "over" is more suitable, indicating a sense of control or authority.

Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.

Error_sentence: Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .

Correct_sentence: Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: do, Correction: does

The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. In the sentence, "social media" is a singular noun, but the verb "create" is in the plural form "do". To fix this, we need to change the verb to its singular form "does" to agree with the subject "social media". This is because "social media" is a singular entity that performs the action of creating relationships, so it requires the singular verb "does".

Label: 1. The subject here is "social media," which is collective and treated as singular, so the verb should be "does" for subject verb agreement.


------------------------------


Error_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .

Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: the, Correction: 

Explanation: The error is the unnecessary use of the definite article "the" before the noun "face-to-face human contacts". The correct sentence uses the singular form "contact" instead, so the article "the" is not needed.

2. Error: contacts, Correction: contact

Explanation: The error is the plural form "contacts" instead of the singular form "contact". The phrase "face-to-face human contact" refers to a single instance or experience of human interaction, so the correct form is the singular "contact".

Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.

Error_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .

Correct_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: claimed, Correction: claim

The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The subject of the sentence is "Many of the teenagers today", which is a plural noun. The verb "claimed" is in the singular form, which does not agree with the plural subject. The corrected verb "claim" is in the plural form, which agrees with the subject.

Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.


------------------------------


Error_sentence: Human has their own rights and privacy .

Correct_sentence: Humans have their own rights and privacy .

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: Human, Correction: Humans

The error is a singular noun "Human" instead of the plural noun "Humans". The subject of the sentence is "their own rights and privacy", which is a plural concept, so it should be referred to by a plural noun "Humans" instead of a singular noun "Human".

2. Error: has, Correction: have

The error is a verb "has" in the singular form instead of the plural form "have". The subject "Humans" is a plural noun, so the verb "have" should be used to agree with it. The verb "has" is used with a singular subject, whereas "have" is used with a plural subject.

Label: 1. The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".

Error_sentence: This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .

Correct_sentence: This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both at high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: has, Correction: have

The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The subject of the sentence is "his parents", which is a plural noun, and therefore requires the plural form of the verb "have" instead of "has".

2. Error: under, Correction: at

The error is a preposition mistake. The correct preposition to use in this context is "at", which indicates a state or condition, whereas "under" is not suitable in this sentence.

3. Error: under, Correction: at

This error is the same as the previous one. The correct preposition to use in this context is "at", which indicates a state or condition, whereas "under" is not suitable in this sentence.

4. Error: runing, Correction: running

The error is a verb tense mistake. The correct verb tense to use in this sentence is the present participle "running", which is used to describe an action that is in progress, whereas "runing" is not a valid verb form.

Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.
