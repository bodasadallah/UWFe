Correct sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without permission , this technology should not be placed or implanted in anyone .
Explanations: 1. The word "other
Label: 1. As "permission" is something granted by another person, this is already taken for granted without needing to explicitly say "other's". 
2. You should explicitly state "technology" for clarity.
3. An implant goes inside the body, so you need to use "in" accordingly.





Prediction:  1. The word “would” is used in the wrong tense. It should be “want”. 2. The word “indicates” is used in the wrong tense. It should be “indicate”. 3. The word “carrying” is used in the wrong tense. It should be “carry”. 4. The word “certain” is used in the wrong tense. It should be “certainly”.
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.





Prediction:  1. The word "add-on" is misspelled as "add-ons". 2. The word "media" is misspelled as "media of sharing". 3. The word "entertainment" is misspelled as "entertainment add-on".
