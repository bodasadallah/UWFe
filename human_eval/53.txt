Correct_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Prediction:  1. "Qualified" is an adjective, so it needs to go with a noun, but in this sentence it is being used with the noun "human resource", so you need to use the adverb form, "creatively". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "The lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China".
Erroneous sentence: The government should take the initiative to provide the necessary support to the students who are in need of financial assistance .
Correct sentence: The government should take the initiative to provide the necessary support to students who are in need of financial assistance .

Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "The government should take the initiative to provide the necessary support to students who are in need of financial assistance".

Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
