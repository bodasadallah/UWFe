Correct_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Prediction:  
1. The adjective "qualified" means "having the necessary skills or knowledge to do something." It is used to describe a person who has the necessary skills to do something. In this case, the author is referring to a person who has the necessary skills to do engineering design. The phrase "creative qualified human resource" is redundant because the word "creative" already implies that the person has the necessary skills to do engineering design. The word "qualified" is unnecessary and should be removed.
2. The noun "resource" means "a source of supply, support, or aid." It is used to describe something that can be used to do something. In this case, the author is referring to a person who can be used to do engineering design. The phrase "creative qualified human resource" is redundant because the word "creative" already implies that the person has the necessary skills to do engineering design. The word "resource" is unnecessary and should be removed.

Correct sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of

Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

Correct_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to high-velocity technological advancement .

Error_sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .

Correct_sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .

Prediction:  
1. Use "However" to introduce a contrasting idea.
2. "Using" is a verb form, so use "use" to refer to the action of using social media.
3. "On" is used to refer to the surface of something, so use "over" to refer to the power that social media has over people.
4. "On" is used to refer to the surface of something, so use "over" to refer to the power that social media has over people.

Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.

Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .

Prediction:  
1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific instance of face-to-face human contact, instead of to such instances in general.
2. "Contact" is a countable noun, so it can be made singular or plural. "Contacts" is the plural form.
Erroneous sentence: The social media has become a part of our daily life and it is hard to imagine a day without it .
Correct sentence: The social media has become a part of our daily life and it is hard to imagine a day without it .

Error_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .

Correct_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .

Erroneous sentence: In addition , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family .
Correct sentence: In addition , the carrier might not want to be a burden in her family .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction: a
Explanations:
1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."
Erroneous sentence: In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .

Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.

2. The phrase "at high risk" is more common than "under high risk."
3. The phrase "at high risk" is more common than "under high risk."

Correct sentence: The first thing that I noticed is that the person in the picture is not the same person in the video .

Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.
