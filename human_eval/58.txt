Error_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Correct_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Prediction: 1. "qualified" should be removed because it is redundant with "creative" in the sentence. both words refer to skills or abilities possessed by human resources, so only one is needed to convey the idea effectively.

2. "resource" should be changed to "resources" to make the noun plural. the lack of creative human resources is being discussed in a general sense, so the plural form should be used to indicate that it is not just one resource that is lacking.

Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

Error_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .

Correct_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .

Prediction: 1. error: "polices" 
correction: "police"
explanation: the error lies in using the plural form "polices" instead of the singular form "police" to refer to a law enforcement officer. 

2. error: "hoaxes spreading around" 
correction: "hoaxes from spreading around"
explanation: the error lies in the incorrect use of the word "around" after "spreading." the correct preposition to use in this context is "from" to indicate the action of preventing something from happening.

Label: 1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".

Error_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .

Correct_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .

Prediction: 1. error: "the" should be removed before "social media" and "internet".
explanation: "social media" and "internet" are general concepts, so we don't need to use "the" before them.

2. error: "advance" should be changed to "advanced".
explanation: "advanced" is the correct adjective form needed to modify "society".

3. error: "the cyber" should be changed to "cyberspace" or "the cyber world".
explanation: "cyber" should be used as a noun to refer to the virtual world in this context.

Label: 1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

Error_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement .

Correct_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to high-velocity technological advancement .

Prediction: 1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the extra comma after "nowadays". the correction removes this unnecessary punctuation.

2. the error in the erroneous sentence is the repetition of "further" in "further and further". the correction removes the unnecessary repetition for clarity and conciseness.

Label: 1. The concept of "technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific advancement instead of the progress of technology in general.


------------------------------


Error_sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .

Correct_sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .

Prediction: 1. "the more people using it over us" should be corrected to "the more people use it on us" because the incorrect sentence uses the present participle "using" instead of the base form "use."
2. "on us" is more appropriate in this context than "over us" which implies physical dominance.

Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.

Error_sentence: Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .

Correct_sentence: Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .

Prediction: 1. error: subject-verb agreement mistake. "social media" is a singular noun and requires the singular form of the verb "does" instead of "do."
2. error: repetition of the word "relationships." the sentence could be more concise by removing the unnecessary repetition.

Label: 1. The subject here is "social media," which is collective and treated as singular, so the verb should be "does" for subject verb agreement.


------------------------------


Error_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .

Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .

Prediction: 1. the word "the" before "face-to-face human contacts" is unnecessary and should be removed. 
2. the word "contact" should be singular instead of plural to match the singular verb "has decresed".

Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.

Error_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .

Correct_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .

Prediction: 1. error: "claimed" should be "claim"
explanation: the verb should be in present tense to align with the subject "teenagers today."

2. error: there is an unnecessary space before the comma after "media"
explanation: the space before the comma is not needed and is a formatting error.

Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.


------------------------------


Error_sentence: Human has their own rights and privacy .

Correct_sentence: Humans have their own rights and privacy .

Prediction: 1. error: "human" should be pluralized to "humans" to agree with the plural noun "rights".
2. error: "their" should be changed to "own" to indicate possession correctly.

Label: 1. The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".

Error_sentence: This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .

Correct_sentence: This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both at high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .

Prediction: 1. "has" should be "have" to agree with the plural subject "both of his parents".
2. "under high risk" should be "at high risk" to convey the correct preposition.
3. "runing" should be "running" to correct the spelling error.
4. "know" should be "knows" to match the singular subject "he".

Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.
