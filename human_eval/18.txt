Error_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Correct_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Prediction: 
1. Unnecessary word. "Qualified" is used to refer to people who have passed certain tests or exams, but it's not relevant here. It should be removed.
2. This sentence is talking about human resources in general, so "resource" should be pluralised. The singular "resource" is used to refer to one specific resource, with "resources" referring to multiple ones. For example, "water is a precious resource" refers to water in general, while "these natural resources need to be protected" refers to many different types of resources that exist in nature. Here, the sentence is talking about all kinds of human resources, so "human resources" should be pluralised. Also, the noun phrase "creative human resources" modifies "engineering design processes," so it should be hyphenated: "creative-human resources." 
3. None

Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

Error_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .

Correct_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .

Prediction: 
1. The noun "police" is uncountable, so it cannot be pluralized. The correct expression is "cyber police." Also, as you are referring to multiple people, use the plural "who," not the singular "that." 
2. None

Label: 1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".

Error_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .

Correct_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .

Prediction: 
1. "Usage" is a noun, so it requires either the preposition "of" or the verb "to use". The phrase "frequent usage" means how often something is used, but here you need to say what people are using frequently. This can be expressed with the preposition "on", which indicates where something happens.
2. As there is no article before "social media", it sounds as though you are referring to one specific type of social media (e.g. Facebook). If you mean all types of social media, then you should not use an article. However, if you do want to refer to just one kind of social media, I would suggest restructuring the sentence like this: "A society that socialises through the cyber will be more advanced and adapted to the highly connected world thanks to the frequent usage and reliance on [name of social media]." Alternatively, you could change "the" to "a": "With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet, a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world."

Label: 1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

Error_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement .

Correct_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to high-velocity technological advancement .

Prediction: 
1. The concept of "technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances of technological advancement instead of to the concept in general. This means that it should not have an article. Also, the phrase "high-velocity technological advancement" is redundant because "advancement" already implies speed or velocity. Therefore, either remove "high-velocity" or change it to another word like "rapid." However, I will assume that you were trying to use "high-velocity" to modify "technological," so I would suggest changing it to "cutting-edge" as follows: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to cutting-edge technological advancement. Cutting-edge refers to technology that is at the forefront of current developments, which fits well with the idea of progressing further and further into the future. In addition, there's no need to say "due to" here because what comes next (i.e., "the study in the genetic field") is the result of technological advancement rather than being caused by it. Therefore, simply delete "due to."

Label: 1. The concept of "technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific advancement instead of the progress of technology in general.

Error_sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .

Correct_sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .

Prediction: 
1. "The" is used to introduce a statement or clause that contrasts with what has been said before. In this case, however, the previous sentence does not mention anything about how many people are using social media, so there is no need to add "the." 
2. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "use."
3. When talking about who something is done to, you should use "on," as in "I am writing on paper." But when talking about who something is done by, you should use "over," as in "I am writing over my friend's facebook wall." Here, the verb is "have," which means to possess someone or something, so we would say "power over them."
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "over." 
5. None

Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.

Error_sentence: Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .

Correct_sentence: Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .

Prediction: 
1. The subject here is "social media," which is singular, so use the third person singular "does" to go with it. The phrase "do create" is used when the subject is plural or unspecified, as in "People do create relationships on social media." But because you're talking about one specific type of technology, change "do" to "does." Also, add a space between "Though" and "social media." 
2. None

Label: 1. The subject here is "social media," which is collective and treated as singular, so the verb should be "does" for subject verb agreement.


------------------------------


Error_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .

Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .

Prediction: 
1. "Face-to-face human contacts" is one instance of something that can be counted, so it should not have an article.
2. The phrase "human contact" refers to any kind of interaction between humans, whether online or offline. It does not refer to multiple interactions with different people, so you need to use the singular "contact." Also, because there is no article, I would suggest changing "the importance of..." to "the importance," which sounds better grammatically. 
3. This statement is correct.

Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.

Error_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .

Correct_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .

Prediction: 
1. The present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur frequently, while the past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past. This sentence is talking about what teenagers do now, so use the present tense, "claim." Also, the subject is singular, so use the verb form "claim" instead of "claimed."

Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.


------------------------------


Error_sentence: Human has their own rights and privacy .

Correct_sentence: Humans have their own rights and privacy .

Prediction: 
1. The noun "human" is always plural because it refers to people in general. It should be changed to "humans."
2. The subject here is "humans," which is plural, so use the third person plural form, "have." Also, as you are talking about human rights being something that humans possess, I would suggest changing "has" to "have." This makes it clearer that these rights belong to all humans.

Label: 1. The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".

Error_sentence: This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .

Correct_sentence: This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both at high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .

Prediction: 
1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "both".
2. Incorrect word. The correct expression is "at risk", which uses the preposition "at".
3. Incorrect word. The correct expression is "at risk", which uses the preposition "at".
4. Incorrect conjugation. The verb form should be "running". 
5. None

Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.
