Error_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Correct_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Prediction: 
1. This sentence is talking about human resources in general, so "qualified" should be removed.
2. This sentence is talking about human resources in general, so "resources" should be pluralised.
3. None
4. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "designs" to go with "engineering design processes".
5. None

Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

Prediction: 
1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "police."
2. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "police."

4. Missing space. Insert one between "around" and "these."

Label: 1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".

Correct_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .

Prediction: 
1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. This sentence is talking about the Internet in general and therefore should not have an article.
3. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "adapted".
4. Missing preposition. "Reliance" requires the preposition "on", so it should be changed to "reliance on".
5. None

Label: 1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

Correct_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to high-velocity technological advancement .

Prediction: 
1. The concept of "high-velocity technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances of this concept, instead of to the concept as a whole.
2. This sentence is talking about technological advancement in general and therefore should not have an article.
3. This sentence is talking about technological advancement in general and therefore should not have an article.

Error_sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .

Correct_sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .

Prediction: 
1. "The more people using it over us, the more power they will have on us" is not grammatically correct. It should be changed to "The more people use it on us, the more power they will have over us", which uses the infinitive verb "use".
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "however".
3. None
4. Missing comma. Add a comma after "power".
5. Unnecessary word. Use either "over" or "on" but not both.

Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.

Correct_sentence: Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .

Prediction: 
1. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media" is the third person singular, so use "does" to correspond with it.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media" is the third person singular, so use "does" to correspond with it.

Label: 1. The subject here is "social media," which is collective and treated as singular, so the verb should be "does" for subject verb agreement.

Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .

Prediction: 
1. "Face-to-face" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "contact".
3. None

Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.

Error_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .

Correct_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .

Prediction: 
1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur frequently. This sentence is not talking about something that happened in the past, so use the present tense "claim" instead.
2. Missing comma. Use a comma to separate the clauses.
3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "claim" to go with "teenagers".
4. Spelling mistake. Correct spelling is "regardless".

Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.

Error_sentence: Human has their own rights and privacy .

Correct_sentence: Humans have their own rights and privacy .

Prediction: 
1. When referencing people in general, the plural "humans" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "human" is used to refer to an individual person, with "a human" meaning any person and "the human" meaning one specific person.
2. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "humans."
3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with the subject "humans."
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "privacy."

Label: 1. The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".

Correct_sentence: This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both at high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .

Prediction: 
1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "parents".
2. Incorrect word. "Risk" is a noun, while "at risk" is an idiomatic expression meaning likely to be affected by something negative. The verb "risk" means to expose oneself to danger or loss, as in "I risked my life to save you." The adjective "risky" means exposing one to danger or loss, as in "It's risky to drive without wearing a seatbelt." 
3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "running" to go with "tests".
4. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "run".
5. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "are" to go with "they".
6. Missing article. Add an article, "the", to make it clear which disease is being referred to.
7. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "is" to go with "disease".
8. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "gene".
9. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "test".
10. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "know".

Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.
