        cout<<"Error: "<<word2<<", Correction: "<<word3<<endl;
    }
}
```
cleaned: 1. qualified is an adjective, but here it is used as a noun.
2. resource is a noun, but here it is used as an adjective.
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

Correct sentence: On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .

Errors:

1. Error: side, Correction: hand
2. Error: want, Correction: wants

Explanations:

1. The word “side” is used in the erroneous sentence instead of “hand”, which is the correct word.
2. The word “want” is used in the erroneous sentence instead of “wants”, which is the correct word.
cleaned: 1. The word “side” is used in the erroneous sentence instead of “hand”, which is the correct word.
2. The word “want” is used in the erroneous sentence instead of “wants”, which is the correct word.
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."

cleaned: 1. The word "disadvantage" is plural, so it should be "disadvantages".
2. The word "the" is not needed before "disadvantages".
3. The word "of" should be replaced with "in".
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.

2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .

Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.

Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."

Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."
2. The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.

4. It is weird that people sit around the table but all face their phones and do not talk with each other .
5. It is weird that people sit around the table but all face their phones and do not talk with each other .
Label: 1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.

Error_sentence: Since this is happen more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to .
Correct_sentence: Since this happens more often in countries which are much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child without knowing where the child has been brought to .
Prediction: 
1. The subject of the sentence is “this”, which is a singular noun. Therefore, the verb “happen” should be in the singular form “happens”.
2. The word “the” is unnecessary in this context.
3. The word “country” should be pluralized to “countries” because it is referring to multiple countries.
4. The word “is” should be replaced with “are” because “countries” is a plural noun.
5. The word “back” should be removed because it does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
cleaned: 1. The subject of the sentence is “this”, which is a singular noun. Therefore, the verb “happen” should be in the singular form “happens”.
2. The word “the” is unnecessary in this context.
3. The word “country” should be pluralized to “countries” because it is referring to multiple countries.
4. The word “is” should be replaced with “are” because “countries” is a plural noun.
5. The word “back” should be removed because it does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.

Correct_sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenge for the innovators .
Prediction: 
Challenges is the plural form of the noun ‘challenge’ and challenge is the singular form of the noun ‘challenge’.
2. Error: innovators, Correction: innovator
Explanations:
Innovators is the plural form of the noun ‘innovator’ and innovator is the singular form of the noun ‘innovator’.
3. Error: these procedures, Correction: this procedure
Explanations:
These procedures is the plural form of the noun ‘procedure’ and this procedure is the singular form of the noun ‘procedure’.
4. Error: might, Correction: may
Explanations:
Might is the past tense of the verb ‘may’ and may is the present tense of the verb ‘may’.
cleaned: 2. Error: innovators, Correction: innovator
Label: 1. The pronoun "another" means "one more," so it is singular and cannot be used with the plural "challenges." The singular "challenge" should be used instead.

## Solution

You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction, followed by the explicit errors in this sentence. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.

Erroneous sentence: In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .

Correct sentence: In addition , privacy issues have become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share in the first place .

Errors:

1. Error: issue, Correction: issues
2. Error: has, Correction: have
3. Error: at, Correction: in

Explanations:

1. issue is a singular noun, and issues is the plural form.
2. has is the third person singular form, and have is the third person plural form.
3. at is a preposition, and in is a preposition.
cleaned: 1. issue is a singular noun, and issues is the plural form.
2. has is the third person singular form, and have is the third person plural form.
3. at is a preposition, and in is a preposition.
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about privacy issues in general, so "issue" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Privacy issues" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
3. Incorrect word. The correct expression is "in the first place".




Error_sentence: This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .
Correct_sentence: This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both at high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .
Prediction: 
1. The subject of the sentence is "both of his parents", which is plural. Therefore, the verb "has" should be changed to "have".
2. The phrase "under high risk of having disease C" should be changed to "at high risk of having disease C". This is because "under" implies a lower level of risk, while "at" implies a higher level of risk.
3. The phrase "under high risk of having disease C" should be changed to "at high risk of having disease C". This is because "under" implies a lower level of risk, while "at" implies a higher level of risk.
4. The phrase "runing two separate tests" should be changed to "running two separate tests". This is because "runing" is a misspelling of "running".
cleaned: 1. The subject of the sentence is "both of his parents", which is plural. Therefore, the verb "has" should be changed to "have".
2. The phrase "under high risk of having disease C" should be changed to "at high risk of having disease C". This is because "under" implies a lower level of risk, while "at" implies a higher level of risk.
3. The phrase "under high risk of having disease C" should be changed to "at high risk of having disease C". This is because "under" implies a lower level of risk, while "at" implies a higher level of risk.
4. The phrase "runing two separate tests" should be changed to "running two separate tests". This is because "runing" is a misspelling of "running".
Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.

Error_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
Correct_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
Prediction: 
1. Shall is a modal auxiliary verb used to express obligation or necessity, while should is a modal auxiliary verb used to express advice or suggestion.
2. For is a preposition used to indicate purpose or reason, while to is a preposition used to indicate direction or destination.
3. And is a coordinating conjunction used to join two or more words, phrases, or clauses of equal importance, while or is a coordinating conjunction used to join two or more words, phrases, or clauses of unequal importance.
Explanation 1: Shall is a modal auxiliary verb used to express obligation or necessity, while should is a modal auxiliary verb used to express advice or suggestion.
Explanation 2: For is a preposition used to indicate purpose or reason, while to is a preposition used to indicate direction or destination.
Explanation 3: And is a coordinating conjunction
cleaned: 1. Shall is a modal auxiliary verb used to express obligation or necessity, while should is a modal auxiliary verb used to express advice or suggestion.
2. For is a preposition used to indicate purpose or reason, while to is a preposition used to indicate direction or destination.
3. And is a coordinating conjunction used to join two or more words, phrases, or clauses of equal importance, while or is a coordinating conjunction used to join two or more words, phrases, or clauses of unequal importance.
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.

Correct_sentence: In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees to spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Prediction: 
1. A comma is used to separate two independent clauses that are not joined by a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so).
2. The plural form of network is networks.
3. Spending is the gerund form of the verb spend. Gerunds are formed by adding -ing to the base form of the verb.

2. The plural form of network is networks.
3. Spending is the gerund form of the verb spend. Gerunds are formed by adding -ing to the base form of the verb.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."

3. is used as a preposition before a noun or a noun phrase to indicate a relationship between the noun or noun phrase and the following noun or noun phrase
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Error_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Correct_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .

2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."

2. The word 'personalities' is a plural noun, while the word 'personality' is a singular noun.
Label: 1. The singular noun "thought" refers to a single idea or opinion. For example, "I think I'd like eggs for breakfast" or "She thinks it would be fun to try beekeeping" are two thoughts. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "thoughts" should be pluralized.
2. The singular noun "personality" means a collection of traits, behaviors, or emotional qualities that make up an individual's character. The plural noun "personalities" refers to the personalities of multiple people.




Error_sentence: These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Correct_sentence: These social media makes people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Prediction: 
1. life is a singular noun, but people is a plural noun, so we need to use the plural form of life, which is lives.

Explanations:
3. provide is a verb, but fun is a noun, so we need to use the verb form of provide, which is provide.
4. Error: a lot of, Correction: a lot of
Explanations:
4. a lot of is an adjective phrase that modifies the noun fun, so we need to use the plural form of a lot of, which is a lot of.

Explanations:
5. a lot of is an adjective phrase that modifies the noun fun, so we need to use the plural form of a lot of, which is a lot of.
cleaned: 1. life is a singular noun, but people is a plural noun, so we need to use the plural form of life, which is lives.

Label: 1. The noun "policy" requires either an article or pluralization. The definite article "the" refers to a specific policy, especially one that was mentioned earlier in the text. Because no such policy was mentioned, it should be changed to the indefinite article "a," which refers to one single unspecified policy out of multiple potential policies, or alternately to the plural "policies," which means multiple unspecified policies.

Label: 1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."

To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.

Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".

cleaned: 1. The word "length" is singular, while "lengths" is plural.
2. The word "shorter" is an adjective, while "short" is a noun.
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".

2. Serendipity is usually defined as the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery , and it often results in the invention of a new technology .
3. Serendipity is usually defined as the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery , and it often results in the invention of a new technology .
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.

6. In the erroneous sentence, the word “computer” is used incorrectly. The correct word to use in this context is “friends”.
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".

cleaned: 1. lesser is a comparative form of the adjective little, whereas less is a comparative form of the adjective little.
2. the is an indefinite article, whereas   is a definite article.
Label: 1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.

2. The subject of the sentence is patients with the genetic risk. The verb of the sentence is would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease .
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.

Error_sentence: In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
Correct_sentence: In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
Prediction: 
1. In the erroneous sentence, the word “skill” is used as a singular noun. However, in the corrected sentence, the word “skills” is used as a plural noun. This is because “interpersonal” is an adjective that modifies the noun “skill” and makes it plural.
2. In the erroneous sentence, the word “is” is used as a singular verb. However, in the corrected sentence, the word “are” is used as a plural verb. This is because “interpersonal” is an adjective that modifies the noun “skills” and makes it plural.
3. In the erroneous sentence, the word “is” is used as a singular verb. However, in the corrected sentence, the word “are” is used as a plural verb. This is because “interpersonal” is an adjective that modifies the noun “skills” and makes it plural.

2. Incorrect conjugation. "Interpersonal skills" is the third person plural, so use "are" to correspond with it.

Correct_sentence: There are many people on social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages , however in real life , he or she may not have jobs or live poorly .
Prediction: 
1. The word "in" should be replaced with "on" because "in" is used to indicate that something is located inside something else, while "on" is used to indicate that something is located on the surface of something else.
2. The word "the" should be removed because it is not necessary in this sentence.
3. The word "image" should be replaced with "images" because "image" is a singular noun, while "images" is a plural noun.

5. The word "do" should be removed because it is not necessary in this sentence.
Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.

Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.

Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.

Correct_sentence: These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones .
Prediction: 
1. The subject of the sentence is “advantages”, which is plural, so the verb should also be plural.
2. The word “application” is singular, so the word “applications” should be used instead.
3. The word “in” should be replaced with “on” because mobile applications are accessed on smartphones, not in them.

2. The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.
3. We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".

5. The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to desired deeds .
Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."

Correct_sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .

1. In the erroneous sentence, the word ‘to’ is used instead of the word ‘of’ in the correct sentence.
2. In the erroneous sentence, the word ‘give’ is used instead of the word ‘gives’ in the correct sentence.
cleaned: 1. In the erroneous sentence, the word ‘to’ is used instead of the word ‘of’ in the correct sentence.
2. In the erroneous sentence, the word ‘give’ is used instead of the word ‘gives’ in the correct sentence.
Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.

Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".

3. Explanation:
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.

2. The word “skill” is used incorrectly in the erroneous sentence. In the correct sentence, the word “skills” is used instead of “skill”.






















































































































































































































































































































































































































































cleaned: 1. The word “on” is used incorrectly in the erroneous sentence. In the correct sentence, the word “chatting” is used instead of “on”.
2. The word “skill” is used incorrectly in the erroneous sentence. In the correct sentence, the word “skills” is used instead of “skill”.
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".
2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.

2. The subject is "children," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.

Explanations:
a. The carrier might not want to be the burden in her family.
b. The carrier might not want to be a burden in her family.
cleaned: 2. Error: incur, Correction: incur
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."

When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".

Prediction: 
2. Error: agrees, Correction:  
Explanations:
3. Error: existing, Correction:  
Explanations:
cleaned: 2. Error: agrees, Correction:
Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.

Error_sentence: When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
Correct_sentence: When people around us know that we got a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , whether caring for us too much or keeping away from us .
Prediction: 
1. In the erroneous sentence, the word “certain” is used as an adjective, which modifies the noun “disease”. However, in the correct sentence, the word “certain” is used as an adjective, which modifies the noun “disease”.
2. In the erroneous sentence, the word “altitudes” is used as a noun, which refers to the height or elevation of something. However, in the correct sentence, the word “attitudes” is used as a noun, which refers to a person’s way of thinking or behaving.
3. In the erroneous sentence, the word “us” is used as a pronoun, which refers to the person who has the disease. However, in the correct sentence, the word “us” is used as a pronoun, which refers to the people around the person who has the disease.
cleaned: 1. In the erroneous sentence, the word “certain” is used as an adjective, which modifies the noun “disease”. However, in the correct sentence, the word “certain” is used as an adjective, which modifies the noun “disease”.
2. In the erroneous sentence, the word “altitudes” is used as a noun, which refers to the height or elevation of something. However, in the correct sentence, the word “attitudes” is used as a noun, which refers to a person’s way of thinking or behaving.
3. In the erroneous sentence, the word “us” is used as a pronoun, which refers to the person who has the disease. However, in the correct sentence, the word “us” is used as a pronoun, which refers to the people around the person who has the disease.
Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

Prediction: 
The word restric in the erroneous sentence is a misspelling of the word restrict in the correct sentence.
2. Error: bring, Correction: bring
Explanations:
The word bring in the erroneous sentence is a misspelling of the word bring in the correct sentence.
3. Error: choice, Correction: choice
Explanations:
The word choice in the erroneous sentence is a misspelling of the word choice in the correct sentence.
4. Error: confusion, Correction: confusion

Error_sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .
Correct_sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay for another year in the secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top student in his province .
Prediction: 
1. In the correct sentence, the word "for" is used to indicate the reason why the secondary school offered the student ¥ 100,000.
2. In the correct sentence, the word "the" is used to indicate that the secondary school offered the student ¥ 100,000.
3. In the correct sentence, the word "1" is used to indicate that the secondary school offered the student ¥ 100,000.
4. In the correct sentence, the word "the" is used to indicate that the secondary school offered the student ¥ 100,000.
5. In the correct sentence, the word "the" is used to indicate that the secondary school offered the student ¥ 100,000.

6. In the correct sentence, the word "the" is used to indicate that the secondary school offered the student ¥ 100,000.
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.

Error_sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .
Correct_sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring some negative effects on our daily lives .
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect: in
Correct:  
Explanation: In the erroneous sentence, the word “in” is incorrectly used in the phrase “it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life”. The word “in” should be replaced with “some” to make the sentence grammatically correct.
2. Incorrect: life
Correct: lives
Explanation: In the erroneous sentence, the word “life” is incorrectly used in the phrase “it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life”. The word “life” should be replaced with “lives” to make the sentence grammatically correct.
3. Incorrect: effect
Correct: effects
Explanation: In the erroneous sentence, the word “effect” is incorrectly used in the phrase “it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life”. The word “effect” should be replaced with “effects” to make the sentence grammatically correct.












































































































































































































































































































cleaned: 1. Incorrect: in
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
3. This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.

a. disseminate is a verb.
b. disseminate is a verb.
3. Error: almost, Correction: almost
Explanations:
a. almost is an adverb.
b. almost is an adverb.
4. Error: to, Correction: to
Explanations:
a. to is a preposition.
b. to is a preposition.
cleaned: 2. Error: disseminate, Correction: disseminate
Label: 1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".




Error_sentence: With the aids of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily .

2. This sentence is talking about humans in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "live" to go with "humans".
4. "Aid" used in the sense of help or assistance is an uncountable noun and therefore should not be pluralised.

Correct_sentence: It is also important to use better material that can support buildings during any natural disasters like earthquakes .
Prediction: 
1. The word "create" is used in the erroneous sentence, which means to bring something into existence. However, in the corrected sentence, the word "use" is used, which means to make use of something that already exists.
2. The word "a" is used in the erroneous sentence, which is an indefinite article. However, in the corrected sentence, there is no article used.
3. The word "the" is used in the erroneous sentence, which is a definite article. However, in the corrected sentence, there is no article used.
4. The word "despite" is used in the erroneous sentence, which means in spite of something. However, in the corrected sentence, the word "during" is used, which means at the same time as something.

Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.
