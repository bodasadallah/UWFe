Error_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "qualified" is unnecessary and redundant:
The word "qualified" is not necessary in this sentence because "human resource" already implies that the resource is qualified or skilled. Adding "qualified" makes the sentence repetitive and wordy.

Corrected sentence: "Therefore, the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China."

2. "human resource" is a noun phrase, not a single word:
In the erroneous sentence, "human resource" is written as a single word, which is incorrect. "Human resource" is a noun phrase consisting of two words: "human" and "resource". It should be written as two separate words.

Corrected sentence: "Therefore, the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China."

Note: There is only one error in the original sentence, which is the unnecessary and redundant use of the word "qualified" and the incorrect writing of "human resource" as a single word.
cleaned: 1. "qualified" is unnecessary and redundant:
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle. 




Error_sentence: On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Correct_sentence: On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "side" -> "hand": The correct phrase is "On the other hand", which is an idiomatic expression meaning "on the opposite side" or "in contrast". The word "side" is not suitable in this context, whereas "hand" is the correct choice.

2. "want" -> "wants": The subject-verb agreement error. The subject is "a person", which is a singular noun, so the verb "wants" should be used instead of "want".

No other errors were found in the sentence.
cleaned: 1. "side" -> "hand": The correct phrase is "On the other hand", which is an idiomatic expression meaning "on the opposite side" or "in contrast". The word "side" is not suitable in this context, whereas "hand" is the correct choice.
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Error_sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct_sentence: One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "disadvantage" -> "disadvantages": The error is a plural error. The word "disadvantage" is singular, but the subject "many people" is plural, so the correct form is "disadvantages".

2. "that" -> (no change): The error is a grammatical error. The word "that" is used correctly to introduce the subordinate clause.

3. "loss" -> "loss" (corrected to "loss interest"): The error is a word choice error. The word "loss" is a noun, but it doesn't make sense in this context. The correct word is "loss interest", which is a phrase meaning "to lose interest".

4. "of face-to-face communication" -> (no change): The error is a grammatical error. The phrase "of face-to-face communication" is correctly used to modify the noun "interest".

So, the corrected sentence is: "One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication."
cleaned: 1. "disadvantage" -> "disadvantages": The error is a plural error. The word "disadvantage" is singular, but the subject "many people" is plural, so the correct form is "disadvantages".
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.




Error_sentence: I agree that RFID technology shall not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
Correct_sentence: I agree that RFID technology should not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "shall" -> "should":
The error is a grammatical mistake. "Shall" is a formal, archaic, or conditional verb that is often used in formal documents, laws, or contracts. In this context, "should" is the correct choice because it is a more common and conversational way to express a recommendation or advice.
cleaned: 1. "shall" -> "should":
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 




Error_sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Correct_sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "with cash reimbursement" -> "for cash reimbursement":
The error is the use of "with" instead of "for". "With" is used to indicate accompaniment or association, whereas "for" is used to indicate purpose or intention. In this sentence, "for" is the correct preposition to use because it indicates the purpose of the companies receiving the leaked information.
cleaned: 1. "with cash reimbursement" -> "for cash reimbursement":
Label: 1. The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.




Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "Researches" -> "Research":
Error: Plural noun instead of singular noun.
Explanation: "Research" is a singular noun, referring to a single study or investigation. "Researches" is a plural noun, which doesn't make sense in this context. The correct form is "Research", which is a single study or investigation.

That's the only error in the sentence!
cleaned: 1. "Researches" -> "Research":
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Correct_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason for the halt of the work was that the higher level authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "reason of halt" -> "reason for the halt":
Error: Missing preposition "for"
Explanation: The correct phrase should include the preposition "for" to indicate the purpose or cause of the halt.

2. "the reason" -> "the reason for the halt":
Error: Missing phrase "for the halt"
Explanation: The phrase "the reason" is incomplete and should be followed by the phrase "for the halt" to specify what the reason is for.

3. "of work" -> "of the work":
Error: Missing article "the"
Explanation: The correct phrase should include the article "the" to indicate which work is being referred to.

4. "higher level of authorities" -> "higher level authorities":
Error: Redundant phrase "of authorities"
Explanation: The phrase "of authorities" is unnecessary and can be removed to make the sentence more concise.

5. "thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin" -> "thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin":
Error: No error, but a minor suggestion:
Explanation: The sentence is already correct, but it's worth noting that the phrase "for Harbin" is
cleaned: 1. "reason of halt" -> "reason for the halt":
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.




Error_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Correct_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "polices" -> "police":
The error is a plural form mistake. The correct word is "police", which is a singular noun referring to a law enforcement agency or officer. The word "polices" is a plural form, implying multiple police agencies or officers, which is not the intended meaning in this context.

Corrected sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
cleaned: 1. "polices" -> "police":
Label: 1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".




Error_sentence: When electronic devices are not grounded properly , there is a probability that the user might get an electric shock when he/she accidentally come into contact with the device .
Correct_sentence: When electronic devices are not grounded properly , there is a probability that the user might get an electric shock when he/she accidentally comes into contact with the device .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "come into contact with the device" should be "comes into contact with the device":
	* The subject-verb agreement error: The subject "he/she" is a singular pronoun, so the verb "comes" should be used instead of "come" to maintain consistency.
2. No other errors were found in the sentence.

So, the corrected sentence is: "When electronic devices are not grounded properly , there is a probability that the user might get an electric shock when he/she accidentally comes into contact with the device."
cleaned: 1. "come into contact with the device" should be "comes into contact with the device":
Label: 1. The subject is "he/she," which is singular, so the verb should be singular for subject-verb agreement.




Error_sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct_sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "rely the" should be "rely on":
	* The verb "rely" requires a preposition "on" to indicate the thing or person that one relies on. In this case, the correct phrase is "rely on", not "rely the". The word "the" is an article, not a preposition, and doesn't fit grammatically in this context.
2. "parent" should be "parents":
	* The subject of the sentence is "children", which is plural, so the object of the sentence should also be plural. The correct word is "parents", which is the plural form of "parent", rather than the singular form "parent".

So, the corrected sentence is: "The children rely on the parents to live."
cleaned: 1. "rely the" should be "rely on":
Label: 1. Missing word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. This sentence is either referring to the parents of specific children, or parents and children in general, but either way, "parents" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: To put it in the nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Correct_sentence: To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "nutshell" -> "a nutshell":
The error is a missing indefinite article ("a" instead of "the"). In this context, "a nutshell" is a more common and idiomatic way to express the idea of summarizing something concisely.
cleaned: 1. "nutshell" -> "a nutshell":
Label: 1. "In a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. The phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but the specificity of "the" makes it sound literal. Instead of referring figuratively to something very simple, it would mean something that is literally inside a nutshell.




Error_sentence: This essay will discuss about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
Correct_sentence: This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "about" is incorrect:
The word "about" is used to introduce a topic or subject, but in this sentence, it's not necessary. The phrase "advantages and disadvantages of using social media" already clearly states the topic, so "about" is redundant and can be removed.

Corrected sentence: This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives.

2. "daily life" is incorrect:
The phrase "daily life" is a common way to refer to one's daily routine or experiences, but in this sentence, it's not the correct phrase to use. The correct phrase is "daily lives", which refers to the lives of people in general, rather than just one's own daily routine.

Corrected sentence: This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives.

So, the two errors in the erroneous sentence are:

* Using the incorrect word "about" instead of omitting it.
* Using the incorrect phrase "daily life" instead of the correct phrase "daily lives".
cleaned: 1. "about" is incorrect:
Label: 1. "Discuss" does not need to be followed by a preposition.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connect people globally .
Correct_sentence: It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "saves" -> "connects":
The error is a verb tense inconsistency. The sentence starts with "saves", which is in the present tense, but then switches to "connect" which is also in the present tense. To maintain consistency, the correct verb "connects" should be used throughout the sentence.

Corrected sentence: It is obvious to see that internet saves people's time and also connects people globally.

Explanation: The verb "saves" is in the present tense, indicating that the internet saves people's time in the present moment. To maintain consistency, the verb "connects" should also be in the present tense, indicating that the internet connects people globally in the present moment.
cleaned: 1. "saves" -> "connects":
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Error_sentence: When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends .
Correct_sentence: When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use social media to get in contact with our friends .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "done" -> "out of battery" or "dead"

The erroneous sentence uses the word "done" to describe the state of the phones, which is incorrect. The correct phrase is "out of battery" or "dead", indicating that the phones have run out of power and are no longer functional.

2. "social media" -> "social media" (no error, but a minor suggestion)

The erroneous sentence uses the correct phrase "social media", but it's worth noting that it would be more idiomatic to use the singular form "social media" instead of the plural form "social medias".

3. "to get contact" -> "to get in contact"

The erroneous sentence uses the phrase "to get contact", which is incorrect. The correct phrase is "to get in contact", which means to establish communication or connection with someone.
cleaned: 1. "done" -> "out of battery" or "dead"
Label: 1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. Missing word. The correct expression is "get in contact".




Error_sentence: Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service , personal profile , media of sharing , and other entertainment add-on ( i.e .
Correct_sentence: Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service , personal profile , media of sharing , and other entertainment add-ons ( i.e .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "add-on" -> "add-ons": The error is a missing "s" at the end of the word "add-on". The correct sentence uses the plural form "add-ons" to indicate that there are multiple entertainment features available on Facebook.

So, the corrected sentence is: Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service , personal profile , media of sharing , and other entertainment add-ons ( i.e .
cleaned: 1. "add-on" -> "add-ons": The error is a missing "s" at the end of the word "add-on". The correct sentence uses the plural form "add-ons" to indicate that there are multiple entertainment features available on Facebook.
Label: 1. The sentence is discussing add-ons in general, so "add-on" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .
Correct_sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "over us" should be "on us":
The erroneous sentence uses "over us" to indicate the direction of the action, implying that the people are using something above or above us. However, the correct sentence uses "on us" to indicate that the people are using something on or affecting us, which is the intended meaning.

2. "using it" should be "use it":
The erroneous sentence uses the present continuous tense "using" to describe the action, implying that the people are continuously using something. However, the correct sentence uses the simple present tense "use" to describe the action, which is more suitable in this context.

3. "us" should be "it":
The erroneous sentence uses "us" to refer to the object being used, implying that the people are using themselves. However, the correct sentence uses "it" to refer to the object being used, which is the intended meaning.

4. "However" is missing:
The erroneous sentence starts with "The more people using it over us", which is a declarative statement. However, the correct sentence starts with "However", which is a conjunction used to contrast or add emphasis to the following statement.
cleaned: 1. "over us" should be "on us":
Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.




Error_sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .
Correct_sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "have their right" -> "have the right"

Error: Missing article "the" before the noun "right".

Explanation: The correct sentence uses the definite article "the" before the noun "right" to indicate that it is a specific, already-known right. The erroneous sentence omits this article, making the sentence sound less natural and less clear.

Corrected sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child.
cleaned: 1. "have their right" -> "have the right"
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".




Error_sentence: Overall , I belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
Correct_sentence: Overall , I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "belive" instead of "believe": The error is a simple spelling mistake. The correct spelling of the verb "to think" is "believe", not "belive".

2. No error: The sentence "that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives" is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.

3. No error: The sentence "but he has no obligation to tell still" is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.

However, it's worth noting that the sentence "but he has no obligation to tell still" is a bit unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity. The word "still" is not necessary in this context and could be removed to make the sentence more concise.
cleaned: 1. "belive" instead of "believe": The error is a simple spelling mistake. The correct spelling of the verb "to think" is "believe", not "belive".
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "believe."




Error_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .
Correct_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers from making more effort to do research and design , and they have little motivation to work hard .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "to make more effort to do research and design" -> "from making more effort to do research and design"

Error: Missing preposition "from"

Explanation: The correct sentence uses the preposition "from" to indicate the source or origin of the action "making more effort". In this case, it means that the problem discourages engineers from engaging in the action of making more effort, rather than simply making an effort to do something.

2. "for they will have little motivation to work hard" -> "and they have little motivation to work hard"

Error: Incorrect conjunction

Explanation: The erroneous sentence uses the conjunction "for" to introduce the dependent clause "they will have little motivation to work hard", which is incorrect. The correct sentence uses the coordinating conjunction "and" to connect the two independent clauses, indicating that the problem discourages engineers from making more effort and that as a result, they have little motivation to work hard.
cleaned: 1. "to make more effort to do research and design" -> "from making more effort to do research and design"
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."




Error_sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other 's permission , this should not be placed or implanted to anyone .
Correct_sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without permission , this technology should not be placed or implanted in anyone .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "other 's permission" -> "permission"

Error: Unnecessary apostrophe in "other's". The correct phrase is simply "without permission", as it is an indefinite pronoun referring to permission in general, rather than belonging to someone named "other".

2. "to anyone" -> "in anyone"

Error: Incorrect preposition. The correct phrase is "in anyone", as it indicates the location where the technology should not be placed or implanted, whereas "to anyone" would imply a direction or movement towards someone.
cleaned: 1. "other 's permission" -> "permission"
Label: 1. As "permission" is something granted by another person, this is already taken for granted without needing to explicitly say "other's". 
2. You should explicitly state "technology" for clarity.
3. An implant goes inside the body, so you need to use "in" accordingly.




Error_sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .
Correct_sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one year ago,when I just arrived singapore .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "invoving" should be "involved":
	* The error is a typo, where the correct verb "involved" is replaced with a made-up word "invoving". The correct sentence should use the verb "involved" to indicate the action of starting to use Facebook.
2. "one years" should be "one year":
	* The error is a pluralization mistake, where the correct phrase "one year" is replaced with "one years". The correct sentence should use the singular form "year" to indicate a single period of time.
3. No correction needed for "when I just arrived singapore":
	* The phrase "when I just arrived singapore" is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning. The only potential issue is that "singapore" should be capitalized as "Singapore" since it's a proper noun (the name of a country). However, this is a minor error and the sentence is still understandable.

Overall, the erroneous sentence has two significant errors: a typo and a pluralization mistake, which can be easily corrected to produce a grammatically correct and clear sentence.
cleaned: 1. "invoving" should be "involved":
Label: 1. The phrase "one year" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "years," so it should be the singular "year."




Error_sentence: Therefore , I thought a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "thought" -> "think":
	* Error: The verb "thought" is in the past tense, but the sentence is in the present tense. The correct verb "think" is in the present tense, indicating the speaker's current opinion or thought.
2. (No error)
	* The word "a" is correctly used to indicate that the genetic risk is a specific, known one.
3. (No error)
	* The phrase "should not be obligated" is correctly used to express the idea that the genetic risk should not be required to tell his or her family or relatives.
4. (No error)
	* The pronoun "his or her" is correctly used to refer to the genetic risk, which is a singular entity.
5. (No error)
	* The phrase "family or relatives" is correctly used to refer to the people who may be affected by the genetic risk.

So, the only error is the verb "thought" vs. "think", which changes the sentence from a past thought to a current opinion.
cleaned: 1. "thought" -> "think":
Label: 1. You are expressing an opinion that you hold now, not something that you thought in the past, so you should use the present tense, "think".




Error_sentence: Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies for spying and advertising .
Correct_sentence: Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transferred to the companies for spying and advertising .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "transfer" -> "transferred":
	* Error type: Verb tense inconsistency
	* Explanation: The verb "transfer" is in the present tense, but the sentence is describing a past action (i.e., what happens after something is recorded). To fix this, we change "transfer" to "transferred", which is the correct past tense form of the verb.
2. None! The rest of the sentence is correct.

So, the corrected sentence is: "Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transferred to the companies for spying and advertising."
cleaned: 1. "transfer" -> "transferred":
Label: 1. This is the passive voice, continuing from the phrase "is recorded." The passive voice requires a form of the verb "to be" followed by a secondary verb, which is always the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "transfer" to the past participle "transferred."




Error_sentence: Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
Correct_sentence: Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "shwing" instead of "showing":
The error is a typo, where the correct verb "showing" is replaced with a made-up word "shwing". The correct verb "showing" means to display or exhibit something, in this case, pictures.

2. "travelling experience" instead of "travelling experiences":
The error is a lack of pluralization. The correct phrase "travelling experiences" refers to multiple experiences of traveling, whereas "travelling experience" would refer to a single experience. The addition of the "s" makes the phrase plural and grammatically correct.
cleaned: 1. "shwing" instead of "showing":
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."
2. The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.




Error_sentence: Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is more easier than asking people around in real life .
Correct_sentence: Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is easier than asking people around in real life .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "more easier" -> "easier"

Error: Double negation (using "more" and "easier" together) and incorrect use of the comparative form of the adjective "easy".

Explanation: The correct comparative form of the adjective "easy" is simply "easier", not "more easier". Additionally, using "more" with "easier" creates a double negation, which is incorrect.
cleaned: 1. "more easier" -> "easier"
Label: 1. "More" is never used with "easier" because "easier" already contains the sense of it being "more".




Error_sentence: However , since internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Correct_sentence: However , since the internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "internet" should be "the internet":
The error is a lack of definite article ("the") before the noun "internet". In English, it's common to use the definite article "the" before a noun when referring to a specific, previously mentioned or well-known entity. In this case, "the internet" is a well-known concept, so the correct phrase is "the internet were known".

Corrected sentence: However, since the internet were known, telephone started to give way to social media sites.

2. No error:
The sentence is grammatically correct in this regard. The verb "were known" is in the correct form to agree with the subject "internet".

Corrected sentence: However, since the internet were known, telephone started to give way to social media sites.

Note: There is only one error in the original sentence, which is the lack of the definite article "the" before the noun "internet".
cleaned: 1. "internet" should be "the internet":
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Error_sentence: It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other .
Correct_sentence: It is weird that people sit around the table but all face their phones and do not talk with to other .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "their" -> "their" (no error): The word "their" is correctly used to indicate possession, meaning "belonging to them".
2. "to" -> "with" (error): The word "to" is a preposition indicating movement or direction, whereas "with" is a preposition indicating accompaniment or association. In this sentence, "with" is the correct choice to indicate that people are talking with each other, rather than moving towards or in the direction of each other.
3. "other" -> "each other" (error): The phrase "to other" is not a common or grammatically correct way to refer to two or more people. The correct phrase "each other" is used to indicate that people are interacting with or affecting one another.

So, the corrected sentence "It is weird that people sit around the table but all face their phones and do not talk with each other" is free of errors and conveys a clear and coherent message.
cleaned: 1. "their" -> "their" (no error): The word "their" is correctly used to indicate possession, meaning "belonging to them".
2. "to" -> "with" (error): The word "to" is a preposition indicating movement or direction, whereas "with" is a preposition indicating accompaniment or association. In this sentence, "with" is the correct choice to indicate that people are talking with each other, rather than moving towards or in the direction of each other.
3. "other" -> "each other" (error): The phrase "to other" is not a common or grammatically correct way to refer to two or more people. The correct phrase "each other" is used to indicate that people are interacting with or affecting one another.
Label: 1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.




Error_sentence: That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
Correct_sentence: That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "elements" -> "element":
The error is a plural noun ("elements") instead of a singular noun ("element"). The correct sentence uses the singular form "element" because it is referring to a single essential thing, not multiple things.
cleaned: 1. "elements" -> "element":
Label: 1. The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.




Error_sentence: Since this is happen more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to .
Correct_sentence: Since this happens more often in countries which are much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child without knowing where the child has been brought to .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "is happen" -> "happens": The verb "happen" is a singular verb, and it should agree with the plural subject "this". The correct form is "happens" to match the plural subject.

2. "in the country" -> "in countries": The subject "this" is referring to a general phenomenon that occurs in multiple countries, not just one country. Therefore, the correct phrase should be "in countries" to indicate the plural nature of the subject.

3. "or maybe it is impossible" -> "or maybe it is impossible" (no change): This part of the sentence is correct, as it's a conditional clause expressing uncertainty.

4. "for the parents to find the child back" -> "for the parents to find the child": The phrase "back" is unnecessary and makes the sentence sound awkward. The correct phrase "to find the child" is sufficient to convey the intended meaning.

These errors are mainly related to subject-verb agreement, pluralization, and sentence clarity.
cleaned: 1. "is happen" -> "happens": The verb "happen" is a singular verb, and it should agree with the plural subject "this". The correct form is "happens" to match the plural subject.
Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.




Error_sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenges for the innovators .
Correct_sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenge for the innovators .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "challenges" -> "challenge":
The error is a plural noun ("challenges") instead of a singular noun ("challenge"). The correct sentence uses the singular form "challenge" because it is referring to a single obstacle or difficulty that the innovators might face.

So, the corrected sentence is: "However, these procedures might become another challenge for the innovators."
cleaned: 1. "challenges" -> "challenge":
Label: 1. The pronoun "another" means "one more," so it is singular and cannot be used with the plural "challenges." The singular "challenge" should be used instead.




Error_sentence: In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
Correct_sentence: In addition , privacy issues have become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share in the first place .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "issue" should be "issues":
The error is a pluralization mistake. The subject "privacy" is a singular noun, but it refers to multiple issues, so the correct form is "issues" instead of "issue".

Corrected sentence: ... privacy issues ...

2. No error (correct)
The sentence is correct in this part.

3. No error (correct)
The sentence is correct in this part.

4. "at the first place" should be "in the first place":
The error is a preposition mistake. The correct phrase is "in the first place", not "at the first place". "At" is used to indicate a location or direction, while "in" is used to indicate a position or situation.

Corrected sentence: ... that they are not willing to share in the first place ...

These are the two errors in the original sentence.
cleaned: 1. "issue" should be "issues":
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about privacy issues in general, so "issue" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Privacy issues" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
3. Incorrect word. The correct expression is "in the first place".




Error_sentence: This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .
Correct_sentence: This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both at high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "has" -> "have": The subject of the sentence is "his parents", which is a plural noun. Therefore, the verb "have" should be used instead of "has", which is a singular verb.

Corrected sentence: "This means both of his parents have gene A..."

2. "under high risk" -> "at high risk": The phrase "under high risk" is not grammatically correct. The correct phrase is "at high risk", which is a common idiomatic expression.

Corrected sentence: "They are both at high risk of having disease C."

3. "runing" -> "running": The verb "running" is a present participle (a verb ending in "-ing" that is used to describe an action that is ongoing) and should be used instead of the incorrect "runing".

Corrected sentence: "They could save the cost of running two separate tests..."

4. "know" -> "know that": The verb "know" is a transitive verb that requires an object. In this case, the object is the clause "that he has the gene Aa". The correct phrase is "know that".

Corrected sentence: "If
cleaned: 1. "has" -> "have": The subject of the sentence is "his parents", which is a plural noun. Therefore, the verb "have" should be used instead of "has", which is a singular verb.
Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.




Error_sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Correct_sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "next generation" -> "the next generation":
Error: Missing definite article "the"
Explanation: The correct sentence uses the definite article "the" before "next generation" to make it clear which generation is being referred to. Without the article, the sentence is ambiguous and unclear.

That's the only error I found in the sentence. Let me know if you have any further questions!
cleaned: 1. "next generation" -> "the next generation":
Label: 1. Missing article. As you are talking specifically about the next generation, use the definite article, "the".




Error_sentence: The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people .
Correct_sentence: The social network may also creat some negative impacts for people .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "creat" instead of "create":
The error is a typo, where the correct verb form "create" is replaced with the incorrect form "creat". The correct verb form "create" is needed to maintain grammatical accuracy and clarity in the sentence.

Corrected sentence: The social network may also create some negative impacts for people.

Let me know if you'd like me to explain anything else!
cleaned: 1. "creat" instead of "create":
Label: 1. The concept of "people" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of people instead of to people in general.




Error_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
Correct_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "shall not" -> "should not":
	* "Shall" is a more formal and archaic verb that is often used in formal documents or in specific contexts. In this sentence, "should not" is a more common and idiomatic way to express the idea of something being undesirable or unacceptable.
2. "for the public" -> "to the public":
	* "For" is often used to indicate the recipient or beneficiary of something, whereas "to" is used to indicate the direction or scope of something. In this sentence, "to the public" is a more natural and common way to express the idea of something being available to the public.
3. (No error, but a suggestion for improvement)
	* The phrase "or taken for granted" is a good addition to the sentence, as it emphasizes the importance of not taking RFID technology for granted. However, it could be rephrased to "or taken lightly" to make the sentence even clearer and more concise.

Overall, the corrections aim to make the sentence more natural, idiomatic, and clear in its meaning.
cleaned: 1. "shall not" -> "should not":
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.




Error_sentence: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Correct_sentence: In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees to spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "In corporate world" -> "In the corporate world":
Error: Missing article "the"
Explanation: The correct sentence uses the definite article "the" to refer to a specific corporate world, whereas the erroneous sentence omits it, making the phrase sound vague and indefinite.

2. "social media network" -> "social media networks":
Error: Singular noun instead of plural
Explanation: Social media refers to multiple platforms, so the correct sentence uses the plural form "networks" to accurately describe the concept.

3. "to prevent employees to spend" -> "to prevent employees from spending":
Error: Incorrect preposition and verb form
Explanation: The correct sentence uses the preposition "from" to indicate the action of preventing employees from engaging in an activity, whereas the erroneous sentence uses "to" which is incorrect in this context. Additionally, the verb "spend" should be in the gerund form "spending" to indicate the action being prevented.

Let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything!
cleaned: 1. "In corporate world" -> "In the corporate world":
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."




Error_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .
Correct_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used on the social media sites .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "the more of the writing skills" -> "the more writing skills"

Error: Missing article "the" before "writing skills". The correct phrase should be "the more writing skills" to indicate that the subject is referring to a specific quantity of writing skills.

2. "will be reduced when the more time" -> "will be reduced when the more time is used"

Error: Missing verb "is" after "time". The correct phrase should be "when the more time is used" to indicate the condition under which the writing skills will be reduced.

3. "used in the social media sites" -> "used on the social media sites"

Error: Incorrect preposition "in" instead of "on". The correct phrase should be "used on the social media sites" to indicate the location where the time is being used (i.e., on the social media sites).

These errors are likely due to a lack of attention to detail and a failure to proofread the sentence carefully.
cleaned: 1. "the more of the writing skills" -> "the more writing skills"
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Error_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Correct_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "despite of the distance" -> "despite the distance"

Error: Incorrect use of preposition "of" instead of "the".

Explanation: The correct phrase should be "despite the distance", not "despite of the distance". "Of" is used to indicate possession or origin, whereas "the" is used to indicate a relationship of opposition or contrast. In this context, "despite the distance" means "in spite of the fact that there is a distance", whereas "despite of the distance" would imply that the distance is the possessor or origin of something, which doesn't make sense in this sentence.
cleaned: 1. "despite of the distance" -> "despite the distance"
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. If you were using "in spite" it would be okay to write "in spite of the distance", but "of" is not necessary when using "despite".




Error_sentence: Therefore , the social media is truly good for people .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , social media is truly good for people .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "the social media" -> "social media"

Error: Unnecessary article "the"

Explanation: In this sentence, "social media" is a common noun and does not need the definite article "the" before it. The sentence is trying to make a general statement about social media, so it should be written as "social media" without the article.
cleaned: 1. "the social media" -> "social media"
Label: 1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.




Error_sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Correct_sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal moral morals the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "personal moral" -> "personal morals": The error is a missing "s" at the end of the word "moral". The correct sentence uses the plural form "morals" to indicate that personal values and principles are being referred to.

2. (No error): The phrase "the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them" is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.

Note: There is no error in the sentence, but if I had to nitpick, I could say that the phrase "how 'directive ' the risk is to them" is a bit unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity. However, this is not a grammatical error per se.
cleaned: 1. "personal moral" -> "personal morals": The error is a missing "s" at the end of the word "moral". The correct sentence uses the plural form "morals" to indicate that personal values and principles are being referred to.
Label: 1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."




Error_sentence: For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Correct_sentence: For example , we tend send birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "For example , we tend send a birthday wishes" -> "For example , we tend send birthday wishes"

Error: Missing article "birthday" before "wishes".

Explanation: The correct sentence should have the article "birthday" before "wishes" to make the sentence grammatically correct and clear in meaning.
cleaned: 1. "For example , we tend send a birthday wishes" -> "For example , we tend send birthday wishes"
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "birthday wishes." Either "birthday wishes" or "a birthday wish" would be acceptable.




Error_sentence: It means that one can not know another 's real thought and personalities by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
Correct_sentence: It means that one can not know another 's real thoughts and personality by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "one can not know" -> "one cannot know"
	* Error: Missing hyphen in "cannot"
	* Explanation: The correct phrase is "cannot" (a single word), not "can not" (two separate words).
2. "another 's" -> "another's"
	* Error: Missing apostrophe
	* Explanation: The possessive form of "another" requires an apostrophe (') to indicate ownership.
3. "real thought" -> "real thoughts"
	* Error: Missing "s" (plural form)
	* Explanation: The word "thought" is a singular noun, and when referring to multiple thoughts, the plural form "thoughts" is used.
4. "personalities" -> "personality"
	* Error: Extra "s"
	* Explanation: The word "personality" is a singular noun, and there is no need to add an extra "s" to make it plural.
5. No error: The phrase "by reading things that he or she put on social network media" is correct.

Overall, the errors in the erroneous sentence are minor and can be easily corrected to produce a grammatically correct and
cleaned: 1. "one can not know" -> "one cannot know"
Label: 1. The singular noun "thought" refers to a single idea or opinion. For example, "I think I'd like eggs for breakfast" or "She thinks it would be fun to try beekeeping" are two thoughts. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "thoughts" should be pluralized.
2. The singular noun "personality" means a collection of traits, behaviors, or emotional qualities that make up an individual's character. The plural noun "personalities" refers to the personalities of multiple people.




Error_sentence: These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Correct_sentence: These social media makes people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "makes people 's life" -> "makes people's lives"
Error: Missing apostrophe and incorrect plural form
Explanation: The correct phrase should be "people's lives" instead of "people 's life". The apostrophe is missing, and the word "lives" should be used in the plural form to agree with the subject "people".

That's the only error I found in the sentence. Let me know if you have any further questions!
cleaned: 1. "makes people 's life" -> "makes people's lives"
Label: 1. The sentence mentions multiple people, so "life" should be pluralised, as there are multiple lives.




Error_sentence: One can not truly understand a person with only stalking his/her facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present .
Correct_sentence: One can not truly understand a person by only stalking his/her facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "can not" -> "can't": The correct contraction for "cannot" is "can't", not "can not". The apostrophe in "can't" indicates that the letters "not" are being omitted.

Explanation: The error is a simple typo, where the writer accidentally typed out the full phrase "cannot" instead of using the correct contraction "can't".

2. "with only" -> "by only": The preposition "with" is not necessary in this sentence, and the correct preposition to use is "by". "By" indicates the means or method by which something is done, whereas "with" indicates accompaniment or association.

Explanation: The error is a misunderstanding of the correct preposition to use in this sentence. The writer may have thought that "with" was the correct choice, but it's actually "by" that conveys the intended meaning.

The corrected sentence is: "One can't truly understand a person by only stalking his/her Facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present."
cleaned: 1. "can not" -> "can't": The correct contraction for "cannot" is "can't", not "can not". The apostrophe in "can't" indicates that the letters "not" are being omitted.
Label: 1. This sentence is saying that one cannot understand a person "through the means of" stalking their Facebook page, and so you need to use "by" here to express the same meaning. It is being used in the same way as "He came by train".




Error_sentence: Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed .
Correct_sentence: Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make the right decision after they have be informed .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "a right" -> "the right":
The error is a lack of definiteness. "A" implies that there is more than one "right" decision, whereas "the" indicates that there is only one specific "right" decision. In this context, "the right decision" is the correct phrase because it refers to a single, specific decision.

Corrected sentence: Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make the right decision after they have been informed .

2. "be informed" -> "been informed":
The error is a verb tense inconsistency. "Be" is a present tense verb, whereas "informed" is a past participle. To form a correct sentence, we need to use the correct verb tense. In this case, "been informed" is the correct phrase because it indicates that the parents have already received the information they need to make a decision.

Corrected sentence: Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make the right decision after they have been informed .
cleaned: 1. "a right" -> "the right":
Label: 1. The sentence is mentioning one specific decision, i.e., the correct one, so use the definite article, "the".




Error_sentence: In conclusion , social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationship and make new friends , as well as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
Correct_sentence: In conclusion , social media in contemporary society is able to help one improve relationships and make new friends , as well as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "contemporary society" should be "in contemporary society":
	* The error is a missing preposition "in". The correct phrase "in contemporary society" indicates the location or context where social media is being used, whereas "contemporary society" is a noun phrase that doesn't provide a clear connection to the verb "is able to help".
2. "relationship" should be "relationships":
	* The error is a singular noun "relationship" instead of the plural noun "relationships". The subject "one" is singular, so the verb "improve" should agree with it by using the plural form "relationships" to indicate multiple relationships being improved.

These corrections improve the clarity and accuracy of the sentence, making it easier to understand the intended meaning.
cleaned: 1. "contemporary society" should be "in contemporary society":
Label: 1. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.
2. When referencing relationships as a general concept, the plural "relationships" should be used because it references multiple relationships between many different people. The singular "relationship" is used to refer to individual relationships, with "a relationship" meaning any relationship and "the relationship" meaning one relationship specifically.




Error_sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about others .
Correct_sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has knowledge about others .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "concurently" -> "concurrently":
	* Error: Typo/Spelling mistake
	* Explanation: The correct word is "concurrently", which means happening or done at the same time. "Concurently" is not a valid word in English.
2. None (no other errors found)

So, the only error in the erroneous sentence is a simple typo/spelling mistake, where "concurently" is replaced with the correct word "concurrently".
cleaned: 1. "concurently" -> "concurrently":
Label: 1. "Knowledge" is an uncountable and abstract noun, so it cannot be made singular or plural, thus it cannot be used with the indefinite article 'a.'




Error_sentence: On one side , it is obvioualy that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Correct_sentence: On one side , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "obvioualy" -> "obvious":
The error is a typo. The correct word is "obvious", which means clearly visible or understood. "Obvioualy" is not a word in English.
cleaned: 1. "obvioualy" -> "obvious":
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "obvious." Also, it looks like the author intended to use the word "obviously," which is an adverb. Adverbs are used to modify verbs, but in this sentence, the word follows "it is" and therefore should be a noun.




Error_sentence: Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
Correct_sentence: Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "do" instead of "does": The subject-verb agreement error. The subject "social media" is a singular noun, so the verb "create" should be in the singular form "does" instead of "do".

Corrected sentence: Though social media does create relationships...

2. (No error) The rest of the sentence is correct.
cleaned: 1. "do" instead of "does": The subject-verb agreement error. The subject "social media" is a singular noun, so the verb "create" should be in the singular form "does" instead of "do".
Label: 1. The subject here is "social media," which is collective and treated as singular, so the verb should be "does" for subject verb agreement.




Error_sentence: Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .
Correct_sentence: Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or afraid of .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "be shy for" -> "be shy for" (no error, this phrase is correct)
2. "or be afraid of" -> "or afraid of" (error: "be afraid of" is correct, but "be" is unnecessary)

Explanation: The error is the unnecessary use of the verb "be" in the phrase "or be afraid of". The correct phrase is simply "or afraid of", as "afraid of" is a prepositional phrase that can stand alone.
cleaned: 1. "be shy for" -> "be shy for" (no error, this phrase is correct)
2. "or be afraid of" -> "or afraid of" (error: "be afraid of" is correct, but "be" is unnecessary)
Label: 1. The first "be" in the sentence can be used for both "shy" and "afraid", you do not need to repeat it for "afraid".




Error_sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Correct_sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook ."

Error: Missing conjunction "and" between "him or her" and "just communicate with friends on facebook".

Explanation: The sentence is missing the conjunction "and" which is necessary to connect the two clauses "neglect people surrounding him or her" and "just communicate with friends on facebook". The corrected sentence should read "In addition, with all those "nice" guys around on the social network website, one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook."
cleaned: 1. "In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook ."
Label: 1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.




Error_sentence: If China can come up with effective policy to change its education system and stimulate innovation , China 's pace to flourish may become even faster .
Correct_sentence: If China can come up with an effective policy to change its education system and stimulate innovation , China 's pace to flourish may become even faster .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "to change its education system and stimulate innovation" should be "to change its education system and stimulate innovations"

Error: Missing plural form for "innovation"

Explanation: The correct sentence uses the plural form "innovations" to match the subject-verb agreement. The original sentence used the singular form "innovation", which is incorrect.

2. No error found.

The rest of the sentence is correct, and there are no other errors.
cleaned: 1. "to change its education system and stimulate innovation" should be "to change its education system and stimulate innovations"
Label: 1. The noun "policy" requires either an article or pluralization. The definite article "the" refers to a specific policy, especially one that was mentioned earlier in the text. Because no such policy was mentioned, it should be changed to the indefinite article "a," which refers to one single unspecified policy out of multiple potential policies, or alternately to the plural "policies," which means multiple unspecified policies.




Error_sentence: In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Correct_sentence: In past decades , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "In the past decades" -> "In past decades":
Error: Missing article ("the")
Explanation: The correct sentence uses the indefinite article "a" instead of the definite article "the" before the noun "past decades". This is because "past decades" is a general time period, rather than a specific one.

2. "when the social media sites are not yet fully developed" -> "when the social media sites were not yet fully developed":
Error: Verb tense inconsistency
Explanation: The sentence uses the present tense "are" to describe a past event, which is incorrect. The correct sentence uses the past tense "were" to describe the past event of social media sites not being fully developed.

3. "people connect with others" -> "people connected with others":
Error: Verb tense inconsistency
Explanation: Similar to the previous error, the sentence uses the present tense "connect" to describe a past event, which is incorrect. The correct sentence uses the past tense "connected" to describe the past event of people connecting with others.

4. "who live far away" -> "who lived far away":
Error: Verb tense inconsistency
Explanation: Again, the sentence uses the present
cleaned: 1. "In the past decades" -> "In past decades":
Label: 1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."




Error_sentence: And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
Correct_sentence: And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering genes is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "altering gene" -> "altering genes":
Error: Singular noun "gene" instead of plural noun "genes".
Explanation: The subject "application" is a singular noun, so it should be paired with a plural verb "are" and a plural noun "genes" to agree with it.

Corrected sentence: ...the application of altering genes...

2. None (no other errors found)

Note: The rest of the sentence is grammatically correct and does not contain any other errors.
cleaned: 1. "altering gene" -> "altering genes":
Label: 1. The technology to alter genetic material could be applied not just to a single gene but any and all genes. For that reason, it's correct to use the plural "genes" rather than the singular "gene."




Error_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement .
Correct_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to high-velocity technological advancement .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "due to the high-velocity technological advancement" -> "due to high-velocity technological advancement"

Error: Unnecessary article "the"

Explanation: The phrase "high-velocity technological advancement" is a noun phrase that refers to a specific concept. Since it's a singular noun phrase, it doesn't need the definite article "the" before it. The corrected sentence removes the unnecessary article, making the sentence more concise and clear.
cleaned: 1. "due to the high-velocity technological advancement" -> "due to high-velocity technological advancement"
Label: 1. The concept of "technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific advancement instead of the progress of technology in general.




Error_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .
Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "contacts" -> "contact": The error is a plural noun error. The correct sentence uses the singular form "contact" instead of the plural form "contacts". This is because "face-to-face human contact" refers to a single instance or experience of human interaction, not multiple instances.

Corrected sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decreased.

Note: I also corrected "decresed" to "decreased", as "decresed" is not a valid word in English.
cleaned: 1. "contacts" -> "contact": The error is a plural noun error. The correct sentence uses the singular form "contact" instead of the plural form "contacts". This is because "face-to-face human contact" refers to a single instance or experience of human interaction, not multiple instances.
Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.




Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "Researches" -> "Research":
Error: Plural noun instead of singular noun.
Explanation: "Research" is a singular noun, referring to a single study or investigation. Using the plural form "Researches" is incorrect.

Corrected sentence: "Research shows..."

2. (No error)
The rest of the sentence is correct, so there are no additional errors to explain.
cleaned: 1. "Researches" -> "Research":
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.




Error_sentence: Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Correct_sentence: Writing is an essential skill for person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "person who" -> "for person"

Error: Missing preposition "for"

Explanation: The correct phrase should be "for person" instead of "who person". The preposition "for" is necessary to indicate the purpose or beneficiary of the skill, which is the person who expresses their own feelings and opinions.
cleaned: 1. "person who" -> "for person"
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the skill of writing) with regard to whom (a person).




Error_sentence: While we do know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
Correct_sentence: While we do know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "them" -> "against them":
The error is a preposition mistake. The correct preposition to use in this context is "against", which indicates the direction or target of the discrimination, rather than "them", which is a pronoun referring to the people being discriminated against.

Corrected sentence: While we do know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations...

Explanation: The correct sentence uses the preposition "against" to indicate that the discrimination is directed towards the people with limitations, rather than simply referring to them as a group.
cleaned: 1. "them" -> "against them":
Label: 1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."




Error_sentence: And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life , products such as RFID tracking system have become real .
Correct_sentence: And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life . Products such as RFID tracking systems have become real .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "products such as RFID tracking system" -> "products such as RFID tracking systems"

Error: Missing plural form

Explanation: The correct sentence uses the plural form "systems" to match the plural subject "products", whereas the erroneous sentence uses the singular form "system". This is because "products" is a plural noun, and it requires a plural verb or a plural noun in a phrase that modifies it.
cleaned: 1. "products such as RFID tracking system" -> "products such as RFID tracking systems"
Label: 1. Use a full stop to separate these two sentences.
2. The sentence is talking about systems in general, so "system" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem .
Correct_sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately becomes really a big problem .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "While , once they are communicating with people in their face" -> "While , once they are communicating with people in their presence"

Error: The phrase "in their face" is not grammatically correct in this context. It seems to be an idiomatic expression, but it's not suitable here. The correct phrase "in their presence" conveys the same meaning, which is that the people are physically present while the communication is taking place.

2. "expressing themselves appropriately become" -> "expressing themselves appropriately becomes"

Error: The verb "become" should be in the singular form "becomes" because it is the subject of the sentence, which is a singular noun phrase "expressing themselves appropriately". The verb agrees with the subject in number, so it should be in the singular form.
cleaned: 1. "While , once they are communicating with people in their face" -> "While , once they are communicating with people in their presence"
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. "Expressing themselves" is the third person singular, so use "becomes" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: More and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life .
Correct_sentence: More and more networking has been transferred to the internet from real life .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "internet" should be "the internet":
The error is a lack of definite article ("the") before the noun "internet". In English, it's common to use the definite article "the" before a specific, previously mentioned noun or a noun that refers to a unique entity. In this case, "the internet" is a specific, widely recognized term, so it's more accurate to use the definite article.

Corrected sentence: More and more networking has been transferred to the internet from real life.
cleaned: 1. "internet" should be "the internet":
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Error_sentence: With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life .
Correct_sentence: With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each other through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important role in our life .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "each others" -> "each other":
The error is a plural possessive pronoun ("each others") used instead of a singular possessive pronoun ("each other"). The correct phrase "each other" is used to refer to two people or things, whereas "each others" would imply multiple people or things.

2. (No error)
There is no error in this part of the sentence.

3. (No error)
There is no error in this part of the sentence.

4. "aspect" -> "role":
The error is the use of a noun ("aspect") that refers to a part or feature of something, instead of a noun ("role") that refers to a part or function that someone or something plays. In this context, "role" is a more suitable choice to describe the importance of face-to-face human interaction in our life.

These explanations provide a simple and clear understanding of the errors in the erroneous sentence and how they can be corrected to produce a grammatically correct and clear sentence.
cleaned: 1. "each others" -> "each other":
Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".




Error_sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
Correct_sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "The society" -> "society"
Error: The erroneous sentence uses the definite article "the" before the noun "society", which is unnecessary. In this context, "society" is a common noun and does not require the article "the". The corrected sentence simply uses the noun "society" without the article.

Corrected sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows.

Explanation: The error is a minor one, but it's a good example of how unnecessary words can make a sentence less concise and clear.
cleaned: 1. "The society" -> "society"
Label: 1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society, instead of the concept in general.




Error_sentence: Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue .
Correct_sentence: Here I want to share Forest 's view on this issue .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "Forest'view" should be "Forest's view":
	* The error is a missing apostrophe (') in the possessive form of the name "Forest". The correct possessive form is "Forest's", which indicates that the view belongs to Forest. The apostrophe is necessary to indicate possession.
cleaned: 1. "Forest'view" should be "Forest's view":
Label: 1. An "s" and a space are missing. There should be an "s" after the apostrophe and "view" should be a separate word.




Error_sentence: People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
Correct_sentence: People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "length" -> "lengths": The error is a singular noun ("length") used in a plural context. In the corrected sentence, the correct plural form "lengths" is used to agree with the subject "great lengths".

Explanation: The sentence is describing an action that people do repeatedly, so the correct form is the plural "lengths" to indicate that they go to multiple lengths to make their words shorter.
cleaned: 1. "length" -> "lengths": The error is a singular noun ("length") used in a plural context. In the corrected sentence, the correct plural form "lengths" is used to agree with the subject "great lengths".
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".




Error_sentence: Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .
Correct_sentence: Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "Seconly" instead of "Secondly":
	* Error: Typo
	* Explanation: The correct word is "Secondly", which is an adverb meaning "in the second place" or "next in order". The erroneous sentence has a typo, replacing the correct word with a similar-sounding but incorrect one.
2. "dignosis" instead of "diagnosis":
	* Error: Spelling mistake
	* Explanation: The correct word is "diagnosis", which is a noun referring to the process of identifying a disease or condition. The erroneous sentence has a spelling mistake, replacing the correct word with a similar-sounding but incorrect one.
cleaned: 1. "Seconly" instead of "Secondly":
Label: 1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "diagnosis".
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "Secondly".




Error_sentence: Serendipity is usually defined as a discovery under an accidental case , and it often results the invention of a new technology .
Correct_sentence: Serendipity is usually defined as the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery , and it often results in the invention of a new technology .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "an accidental case" -> "the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery":
	* The original phrase "an accidental case" is unclear and doesn't convey the intended meaning. The corrected phrase "the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery" accurately describes serendipity, which is the act of finding something valuable or useful when you're not looking for it.
2. "results the invention" -> "results in the invention":
	* The original phrase "results the invention" is grammatically incorrect. The corrected phrase "results in the invention" uses the correct preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or consequence of serendipity leading to the invention of a new technology.

By correcting these errors, the sentence becomes clearer and more accurate in conveying the meaning of serendipity.
cleaned: 1. "an accidental case" -> "the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery":
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.




Error_sentence: The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .
Correct_sentence: The earlier we tell them , the better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "arise" should be "form" or "develop" instead of "arise". The verb "arise" means to come into existence or to appear, which doesn't make sense in this context. The correct verb "form" or "develop" implies that the habit will take shape or become a part of their lives.

Corrected sentence: The earlier we tell them , the better habit they will form and better for the rest of their lives .

2. No error. The sentence is correct.

3. No error. The sentence is correct.

So, the corrected sentence is: The earlier we tell them , the better habit they will form and better for the rest of their lives .
cleaned: 1. "arise" should be "form" or "develop" instead of "arise". The verb "arise" means to come into existence or to appear, which doesn't make sense in this context. The correct verb "form" or "develop" implies that the habit will take shape or become a part of their lives.
Label: 1. The construction "the earlier A, the better B" is talking about specifics, with a greater focus on B. As such, B requires an article, and as you are talking about something specific, you should use the definite article, "the".




Error_sentence: As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Correct_sentence: As a result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "As the result" -> "As a result":
	* Error: Incorrect use of "the" instead of "a".
	* Explanation: "Result" is a singular noun, and "a" is the correct indefinite article to use before it, not "the". "The" is used to refer to a specific, previously mentioned result, whereas "a" is used to refer to a general or indefinite result.
2. (No other errors found)

So, the corrected sentence is: "As a result, it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives, telling the genetic testing result is needed."
cleaned: 1. "As the result" -> "As a result":
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "As the result" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a result," which implies that the outcome is one of several.




Error_sentence: More supports must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of such junction whether should him/her to inform the relatives .
Correct_sentence: More support must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of such junction whether should him/her to inform the relatives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "More supports" -> "More support": The error is a plural noun error. The correct sentence uses the singular form "support" instead of the plural form "supports".

2. "must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of such junction": The error is a preposition error. The correct sentence uses the preposition "of" instead of "standing of". The correct phrase should be "when one is standing at such a junction".

3. "whether should him/her to inform the relatives": The error is a grammatical error. The correct sentence uses the phrase "whether he/she should inform the relatives" instead of "whether should him/her to inform the relatives". The correct phrase is a question asking whether someone should inform the relatives, and the subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the erroneous sentence.

Corrected sentence: More support must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing at such a junction whether he/she should inform the relatives.
cleaned: 1. "More supports" -> "More support": The error is a plural noun error. The correct sentence uses the singular form "support" instead of the plural form "supports".
Label: 1. In the context of care and aid from other people, the word "support" is an uncountable noun and is not pluralized. It generally refers to actions or gestures, which are not tangible and cannot be counted. The word "supports" is a verb form or a noun referring to the structural components of a building that allow it to withstand force.




Error_sentence: Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Correct_sentence: Also , according to research , it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "a research" -> "research": The error is a missing article ("a" or "the") before the noun "research". In English, it's common to use an article before a singular noun, especially when it's a specific or previously mentioned noun. In this case, "research" is a singular noun, so the correct article to use is "the".

Corrected sentence: Also, according to the research, ...

2. "Facebook and this" -> "Facebook": The error is an unnecessary phrase ("and this") that disrupts the sentence's flow. The sentence is already stating a fact, and the phrase "and this" doesn't add any new information. Simply removing it makes the sentence more concise and clear.

Corrected sentence: Also, according to research, it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook ...

These are the two errors I found in the erroneous sentence. Let me know if you have any further questions!

2. This sentence is talking about users in general and therefore should not have an article.
3. "Facebook" is a proper noun and therefore should not have an article.




Error_sentence: As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
Correct_sentence: As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk of have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "can be related to the carrier 's relatives" is correct, but the next part "that is, one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder" is a separate sentence and should be separated by a period (.) instead of a comma (,). The error is a run-on sentence.

Corrected sentence: As many people realize, a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier's relatives. That is, one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder.

2. The sentence "means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it" is incorrect. The correct phrase is "means that other family members also have almost the same risk of having it". The error is a grammatical mistake, specifically the incorrect use of "equally" instead of "same".

Corrected sentence: means that other family members also have almost the same risk of having it.

3. The sentence "so this problem should be treated seriously by the family" is correct, but it seems out of place in the original sentence. It would be better to end the sentence with a period (.) and start a new sentence with this one. The error is a lack of

Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. As "risk" is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".




Error_sentence: Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet .
Correct_sentence: Not only the phone do the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computers , laptops , tablets , and many other devices which are able to connect to the internet .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "Not only the phone did the jobs for them" -> "Not only the phone do the jobs for them"
	* Error: Subject-verb agreement. The subject "phone" is singular, so the verb "do" should be in the singular form "does" instead of "did" (which is the plural form).
2. "phone" -> "phone" (no error, just a minor typo)
3. "jobs" -> "job" (no error, the sentence is using the plural form "jobs" correctly)
4. "for them" -> "for them" (no error, the prepositional phrase is correct)
5. "but also devices like personal computer" -> "but also devices like personal computers"
	* Error: Plural form. The phrase "personal computers" is the correct plural form of "personal computer".
6. "laptop" -> "laptops" (no error, the sentence is using the plural form "laptops" correctly)
7. "tablet" -> "tablets" (no error, the sentence is using the plural form "tablets" correctly)
8. "and many other devices which are able to
cleaned: 1. "Not only the phone did the jobs for them" -> "Not only the phone do the jobs for them"
Label: 1. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and "the computer" meaning one computer specifically.
2. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing laptops as a general concept, the plural "laptops" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "laptop" is used to refer to an individual laptop, with "a laptop" meaning any laptop and "the laptop" meaning one laptop specifically.
3. The plural noun "tablet" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing tablets as a general concept, the plural "tablets" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "tablet" is used to refer to an individual tablet, with "a tablet" meaning any tablet and "the tablet" meaning one tablet specifically.
4. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.
5. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "did" implies that the phone is no longer involved in people's work, so it should be the present tense "do" instead.




Error_sentence: Another problem with social media is that , the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not relfected as something positive to the users .
Correct_sentence: Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not reflected as something positive to the users .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "relefected" instead of "reflected":
The error is a simple typo. The correct verb "reflected" means to show or express something, whereas "relefected" is not a valid word. The corrected sentence uses the correct verb "reflected" to convey the intended meaning.

In the corrected sentence, the phrase "is not reflected" means that the benefits from investing time and energy are not being shown or expressed as something positive to the users.
cleaned: 1. "relefected" instead of "reflected":
Label: 1. Unnecessary comma. The position of the comma is grammatically incorrect.
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "reflected".




Error_sentence: I do not agree on this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Correct_sentence: I do not agree with this statement that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "on" instead of "with":
The erroneous sentence uses "on" instead of "with" in the phrase "I do not agree on this argument". The correct preposition "with" is used to indicate agreement or concurrence with a statement, whereas "on" is typically used to indicate a physical or metaphorical location. In this context, "with" is the correct choice because it indicates agreement with the statement.

Corrected sentence: I do not agree with this argument...

2. No error:
The rest of the sentence is correct, and there is no error in the phrase "that surveillance technology should not be used to track people".
cleaned: 1. "on" instead of "with":
Label: 1. If you "agree on" something it usually means you reach a compromise with someone. When talking about an opinion and saying whether you agree or disagree, "agree" is usually followed by the preposition "with".
2. Incorrect word choice. This is an opinion/assertion that is being stated, so use "statement".




Error_sentence: However , critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
Correct_sentence: However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "sites have" -> "sites has":
Error: Subject-verb agreement error.
Explanation: The subject "sites" is a plural noun, but the verb "has" is in the singular form. The correct verb form should be "have" to agree with the plural subject.

Corrected sentence: ...the existence of social media sites have...

2. No error.
3. No error.

Note: There are only two errors in the original sentence. The rest of the sentence is correct.
cleaned: 1. "sites have" -> "sites has":
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".




Error_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Correct_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "reliance of the social media and the Internet" -> "reliance on social media and the Internet"

Error: Missing preposition "on" before "social media and the Internet".

Explanation: The correct phrase should include the preposition "on" to indicate the reliance on social media and the Internet, rather than simply stating that social media and the Internet are the objects of reliance.

Corrected sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet, a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world.
cleaned: 1. "reliance of the social media and the Internet" -> "reliance on social media and the Internet"
Label: 1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.




Error_sentence: Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .
Correct_sentence: Social media provides people with a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "a way of" -> "with a way of":
The error is a missing preposition. The correct sentence uses the preposition "with" to indicate the relationship between "people" and "a way of talking and chatting". The erroneous sentence uses "a way of" which is not grammatically correct in this context.

Explanation: The preposition "with" is used to indicate possession or association, whereas "a way of" is a phrase used to describe a method or manner. In this sentence, "with" is the correct choice to indicate that people have or use a way of talking and chatting.
cleaned: 1. "a way of" -> "with a way of":
Label: 1. Missing word. Use "with" to link "provides" and "a way of talking and chatting" so we know what is being provided by social media.




Error_sentence: As we all know , the interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas .
Correct_sentence: As we all know , interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "the interpersonal skills" -> "interpersonal skills"

Error: Article "the" is unnecessary.

Explanation: In this sentence, "interpersonal skills" is a singular noun, and it doesn't need an article "the" to modify it. The correct sentence uses the noun phrase "interpersonal skills" without the article "the".
cleaned: 1. "the interpersonal skills" -> "interpersonal skills"
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general and therefore should not have an article.




Error_sentence: Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "is need" -> "a need":
The error is a lack of an article ("a" or "the") before the noun "need". In English, it's common to use an article before a singular noun, especially when it's the object of a preposition (in this case, "to discuss"). The corrected sentence uses the indefinite article "a" to indicate that the need is a general or unspecified one.

So, the corrected sentence is: "Therefore, there is a need to discuss..."
cleaned: 1. "is need" -> "a need":
Label: 1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need. There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.




Error_sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Correct_sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "it lessens" -> "it lessens" (no error, this part is correct)
2. "valuable interaction between human" -> "valuable interaction between human" (no error, this part is correct)
3. "and time" -> "and the time" (Error: Missing article "the" before "time". The correct sentence uses the definite article "the" to refer to a specific time, whereas the erroneous sentence omits it, making the sentence unclear.)

So, the corrected sentence is: "Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone."
cleaned: 1. "it lessens" -> "it lessens" (no error, this part is correct)
2. "valuable interaction between human" -> "valuable interaction between human" (no error, this part is correct)
3. "and time" -> "and the time" (Error: Missing article "the" before "time". The correct sentence uses the definite article "the" to refer to a specific time, whereas the erroneous sentence omits it, making the sentence unclear.)
Label: 1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.




Error_sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than five percent of the population in the China .
Correct_sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than five percent of the population in China .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "lesser" -> "less":
The error is in the word choice. "Lesser" is used to compare quantities of the same kind, whereas "less" is used to compare quantities of different kinds. In this sentence, we are comparing two different populations, so we should use "less" instead of "lesser".

Corrected sentence: For example, five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than five percent of the population in China.

Let me know if you'd like me to explain anything else!
cleaned: 1. "lesser" -> "less":
Label: 1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.




Error_sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Correct_sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "latest news and updates" should be "the latest news and updates"

Error: Missing article "the"

Explanation: The correct sentence uses the definite article "the" before "latest news and updates" to indicate that it is referring to a specific set of news and updates, whereas the erroneous sentence omits the article, making the phrase seem vague and indefinite.
cleaned: 1. "latest news and updates" should be "the latest news and updates"
Label: 1. Missing article. As our planet is a countable noun but also the only one we know of, we call it "the world".




Error_sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease .
Correct_sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance of carrying certain disease .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "indicates" -> "of carrying":
Error: Missing preposition "of"
Explanation: The correct sentence uses the preposition "of" to indicate the relationship between the genetic risk and the chance of carrying a certain disease. Without "of", the sentence is unclear and grammatically incorrect.

Corrected sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance of carrying certain disease
cleaned: 1. "indicates" -> "of carrying":
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.




Error_sentence: Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts .
Correct_sentence: Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotional thoughts .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "emotinal" instead of "emotional":
The error is a simple typo, where the correct word "emotional" was replaced with a similar-sounding but incorrect word "emotinal". The correct word "emotional" refers to feelings or emotions, whereas "emotinal" is not a valid word.

Corrected sentence: Thus, having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotional thoughts.

Let me know if you'd like me to explain anything else!
cleaned: 1. "emotinal" instead of "emotional":
Label: 1. This is a typo. The correct spelling is "emotional."




Error_sentence: It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
Correct_sentence: It provides people with a more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "convenient contact environment" should be "a convenient contact environment":
	* The error is the lack of the indefinite article "a" before the noun "convenient contact environment". In English, when we describe a noun with an adjective, we typically use the indefinite article "a" before the noun. In this case, "a" is used to indicate that the speaker is referring to a specific, but indefinite, convenient contact environment.
2. No error (the sentence is grammatically correct up to this point).
3. "each others" should be "each other":
	* The error is the use of the plural form "each others" instead of the singular form "each other". When referring to two people or things, we use the singular form "each other", whereas when referring to more than two people or things, we use the plural form "each others". In this case, since the sentence is referring to two people or things (the speaker and someone else), the correct form is "each other".
cleaned: 1. "convenient contact environment" should be "a convenient contact environment":
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is used when something exists in an unspecified manner or amount, or to express one out of multiple options. The phrase "convenient contact environment" means one potential environment out of many, with varying degrees of convenience. This condition is best expressed by the indefinite article "a."




Error_sentence: This essay will discuss about both the benefits and down sides of using social media in the contemporary society .
Correct_sentence: This essay will discuss both the benefits and down sides of using social media in contemporary society .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "about" is unnecessary:
The word "about" is not needed in this sentence. It's a filler word that doesn't add any meaning to the sentence. In this case, the sentence is already clear and concise without it.

Corrected sentence: This essay will discuss both the benefits and down sides of using social media in contemporary society.

2. "contemporary society" should not be hyphenated:
The phrase "contemporary society" is a compound noun, and it doesn't need to be hyphenated. The hyphen is unnecessary and makes the sentence look awkward.

Corrected sentence: This essay will discuss both the benefits and down sides of using social media in contemporary society.

3. "down sides" is a common error:
The correct phrase is "downsides". The word "down" is an adjective modifying the noun "sides", and it should be in the singular form "downside" if it's referring to one aspect. However, since the sentence is listing multiple aspects, the plural form "downsides" is used.

Corrected sentence: This essay will discuss both the benefits and downsides of using social media in contemporary society.

The corrected sentence is
cleaned: 1. "about" is unnecessary:
Label: 1. The verb "discuss" does not take the preposition "about." While "about" is used with similar verbs like "tell" or "talk," in the case of "discuss," the object simply comes directly after, with no need for a preposition.
2. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.




Error_sentence: Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .
Correct_sentence: Although surveillance technology is an issue in safeguarding human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "invading" -> "safeguarding":
Error: The word "invading" is incorrect because it implies that the surveillance technology is intentionally breaching human privacy, which is not the intended meaning. The correct word "safeguarding" conveys that the technology is intended to protect human privacy, not invade it.

Corrected sentence: Although surveillance technology is an issue in safeguarding human privacy, ...

This correction changes the tone of the sentence from one of intentional invasion to one of potential misuse or unintended consequences.
cleaned: 1. "invading" -> "safeguarding":
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about surveillance technology in general and therefore does not need an article.
2. None
3. The sentence is discussing human privacy in general, so it does not require an article.




Error_sentence: Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Correct_sentence: Some genes will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "Some genetic gene" -> "Some genes"
Error: The word "gene" is repeated, which is incorrect. A gene is a single unit of heredity, so it's not possible to have multiple genes. The correct word is "genes", which refers to multiple units of heredity.

2. (No error)
The sentence is correct in this part.

3. "will pass only to boys rather than girls" -> "will pass only to boys rather than girls" (No change)
Error: None, the sentence is already correct.

4. "some are on the contrary"
Error: This sentence is not grammatically correct and doesn't make sense in the context of the original sentence. The correct sentence is "some are on the contrary" -> "some are, on the contrary", which is a correct way to use the phrase "on the contrary" to indicate a contrast.

So, the corrected sentence is: "Some genes will pass only to boys rather than girls, some are, on the contrary."
cleaned: 1. "Some genetic gene" -> "Some genes"
Label: 1. The adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted.
2. The word "some" means an unspecified amount or a large amount. It is usually used with plural nouns. Also, it is unlikely that there is only one gene that can only be inherited by a specific gender, so logically it is more likely to be the plural.




Error_sentence: Many people says they will support the social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
Correct_sentence: Many people say they will support social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "says" -> "say":
Error: Subject-verb agreement error.
Explanation: The subject of the sentence is "Many people", which is a plural noun. The verb "says" is in the singular form, which doesn't agree with the plural subject. The corrected verb "say" is in the plural form, agreeing with the subject.

2. No error (correct)
3. "social media" -> "social media" (no change needed)
4. No error (correct)
5. "really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world" -> "really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world" (no change needed)

Note: There are no other errors in the sentence. The corrected sentence is grammatically correct and free of errors.
cleaned: 1. "says" -> "say":
Label: 1. The subject here is the plural "people," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "say."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.




Error_sentence: As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
Correct_sentence: As time passes , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "passed" -> "passes":
The error is a verb tense inconsistency. In the original sentence, "As time passed" is in the past tense, but "we may have more" is in the present tense. To maintain consistency, the verb "passed" should be changed to "passes" to match the present tense of the rest of the sentence.

Corrected sentence: As time passes, ...

This correction ensures that the sentence has a consistent verb tense throughout.
cleaned: 1. "passed" -> "passes":
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.




Error_sentence: In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
Correct_sentence: In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "interpersonal skill" -> "interpersonal skills":
Error: Missing plural form
Explanation: The subject "skills" is a plural noun, so it should be in the plural form "skills" instead of the singular form "skill".

Corrected sentence: In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
cleaned: 1. "interpersonal skill" -> "interpersonal skills":
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Interpersonal skills" is the third person plural, so use "are" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: There are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages , however in real life , he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly .
Correct_sentence: There are many people on social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages , however in real life , he or she may not have jobs or live poorly .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "social media" should be "on social media"
	* Error: Missing preposition "on"
	* Explanation: The correct phrase "on social media" indicates that the people are present or active on social media, whereas "social media" alone is a noun phrase that refers to the platform itself.
2. "beautiful image" should be "beautiful images"
	* Error: Singular noun instead of plural
	* Explanation: The subject "people" is plural, so the corresponding noun "images" should also be plural to agree with it.
3. "good content" should be "good content" (no change needed)
	* Error: None
	* Explanation: The phrase "good content" is already correct and does not need any changes.
4. "in their pages" should be "on their pages"
	* Error: Incorrect preposition
	* Explanation: The correct preposition "on" is used to indicate the location of the content on the pages, whereas "in" would imply that the content is inside the pages.
5. "however in real life" should be "however, in real life"
	* Error: Missing comma
	* Explanation
cleaned: 1. "social media" should be "on social media"
Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.




Error_sentence: The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him .
Correct_sentence: The medical treatment technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "is" instead of "was": The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The sentence is talking about a past time ("during that time"), so the verb "was" should be used instead of "is", which is used for present tense.

Corrected sentence: The medical treatment technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him.

Let me know if you'd like me to explain anything else!
cleaned: 1. "is" instead of "was": The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The sentence is talking about a past time ("during that time"), so the verb "was" should be used instead of "is", which is used for present tense.
Label: 1. Talking about something that happened in the past, so use the past tense "was".




Error_sentence: Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for the society .
Correct_sentence: Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "society" -> "society" (no error, but I'll explain it anyway!)
The word "society" is correctly used in the sentence, referring to the collective community of people.

2. "the society" -> "society" (error)
The original sentence has "the society", which is incorrect. The definite article "the" is not needed before the noun "society", as it's a general term and not a specific one. The corrected sentence simply uses "society" without the article.

So, the corrected sentence is: Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society.
cleaned: 1. "society" -> "society" (no error, but I'll explain it anyway!)
Label: 1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific societies, instead of modern society in general.




Error_sentence: Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
Correct_sentence: Personally I am studying oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friends .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "study" -> "studying":
Error: Missing "-ing" suffix
Explanation: The verb "study" should be in the present participle form "studying" to indicate an ongoing action.

2. "in oversea" -> "oversea":
Error: Incorrect preposition
Explanation: The correct preposition to use with "oversea" (meaning abroad or overseas) is simply "oversea", not "in".

3. "contact my old friend" -> "contact my old friends":
Error: Singular noun vs. plural noun
Explanation: The subject "old friend" is a singular noun, but the verb "contact" is in the plural form "keep away from contact". To match the subject-verb agreement, the noun "friend" should be changed to the plural form "friends".
cleaned: 1. "study" -> "studying":
Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.




Error_sentence: Human has their own rights and privacy .
Correct_sentence: Humans have their own rights and privacy .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "Human" should be "Humans":
	* Error: Singular noun instead of plural noun.
	* Explanation: The subject of the sentence is "rights and privacy", which are collective and belong to multiple individuals. Therefore, the subject should be in the plural form "Humans" instead of the singular form "Human".
2. No error (no correction needed).

So, the corrected sentence is: "Humans have their own rights and privacy".
cleaned: 1. "Human" should be "Humans":
Label: 1. The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".




Error_sentence: He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet .
Correct_sentence: He can even talk to his daughter face-to-face using video call via the internet .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "her" -> "his": The error is a pronoun agreement mistake. The possessive pronoun "her" is used to refer to a female, whereas "his" is used to refer to a male. Since the sentence is talking about the speaker's daughter, the correct pronoun to use is "his".

Corrected sentence: He can even talk to his daughter...

2. No error (the sentence is correct)

3. No error (the sentence is correct)

4. No error (the sentence is correct)

5. No error (the sentence is correct)

The only error in the sentence is the incorrect use of the pronoun "her" instead of "his" to refer to the speaker's daughter.
cleaned: 1. "her" -> "his": The error is a pronoun agreement mistake. The possessive pronoun "her" is used to refer to a female, whereas "his" is used to refer to a male. Since the sentence is talking about the speaker's daughter, the correct pronoun to use is "his".
Label: 1. Missing article. "Internet" is the name of a specific network, so use the definite article, "the".
2. The sentence starts with "He", referring to man, but the third person possessive you have used is the female version. Change to "his" to match with "He" and make it clear that you are talking about a man.




Error_sentence: There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Correct_sentence: There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "out for" -> "out" (Error: Unnecessary word)

The erroneous sentence has the phrase "out for", which is not necessary in this context. The correct sentence simply uses the phrase "out attention", which is a common idiomatic expression meaning to seek attention or attention-seeking behavior.

Corrected sentence: There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks.

2. 's -> (Error: Apostrophe misuse)

The erroneous sentence uses an apostrophe ('s) to form the possessive form of "one", which is incorrect. The correct sentence uses the apostrophe-less form "one's" to indicate possession.

Corrected sentence: There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one's true opinion on social networks.
cleaned: 1. "out for" -> "out" (Error: Unnecessary word)
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Seek out" does not require the preposition "for" to indicate what is being sought out.




Error_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Correct_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "claimed" -> "claim":
The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The subject of the sentence is "Many of the teenagers", which is a plural noun, so the verb "claim" should be in the plural form "claim" instead of "claimed", which is the singular form.

Explanation: The verb "claim" should agree with the subject "Many of the teenagers", which is a plural noun, so the correct verb form is "claim" instead of "claimed".
cleaned: 1. "claimed" -> "claim":
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.




Error_sentence: These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones .
Correct_sentence: These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "comes" -> "come":
Error: Subject-verb agreement error.
Explanation: The subject of the sentence is "advantages", which is a plural noun. Therefore, the verb "come" should be in the plural form "come" instead of "comes".

2. "mobile application" -> "mobile applications":
Error: Plural form error.
Explanation: The phrase "mobile application" is singular, but the subject "sites" is plural. To maintain consistency, the phrase should be changed to the plural form "mobile applications".

3. No error: The phrase "on our smartphones" is correct and does not need any changes.

So, the corrected sentence is: "These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones."
cleaned: 1. "comes" -> "come":
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "come" to go with "advantages".
2. The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.
3. We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".




Error_sentence: Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
Correct_sentence: Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional checks or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "Secondly" is correct, as it is a proper transition word to start a second point.

2. "annouance" should be "announce". The correct verb is "announce", not "annouance". "Announce" means to make a public declaration or to inform someone of something.

3. The sentence structure is correct, but the word "thus" is not necessary and can be removed without affecting the meaning.

4. "do additional check" should be "do additional checks". The verb "check" is plural, so it should be followed by the plural form "checks".

5. "or take more medicine" is correct, as it provides two possible actions people might take to prevent the disease.

6. "and this creats" should be "and this creates". The verb "creates" is in the present tense, so it should be in the base form "creates", not "creats".

7. "unnecessary costs to the family" is correct, as it summarizes the consequence of people taking unnecessary actions to prevent the disease.

Note: There are no other errors in the sentence, and the correction provided is identical to the erroneous sentence.
cleaned: 1. "Secondly" is correct, as it is a proper transition word to start a second point.
Label: 1. From the sentence we can surmise that the people would have more than one check, so the plural "checks" should be used.




Error_sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Correct_sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spending too much time on the internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "spend" -> "spending":
Error: Verb tense inconsistency
Explanation: The sentence starts with "In conclusion", which is a concluding statement, and then uses the present tense "spend". However, the verb "spend" should be in the gerund form "spending" to match the present participle verb "using" in the sentence.

Corrected sentence: "spending" instead of "spend"
cleaned: 1. "spend" -> "spending":
Label: 1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.




Error_sentence: Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .
Correct_sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers" -> "The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers"

Error: The verb "fused" is incorrect. The correct verb is "by", which indicates the agency or means by which the process is defined.

2. "in the aid of developing" -> "in the aid of developing"

Error: No error. This phrase is correct.

3. "either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on" -> "either an entirely new system or improvising on the current"

Error: The word "on" is unnecessary and creates a grammatical error. The correct phrase is simply "either an entirely new system or improvising on the current".

4. "to cater to desired deeds" -> "to cater to"

Error: The phrase "desired deeds" is unnecessary and creates a vague or unclear meaning. The correct phrase is simply "to cater to", which means to provide for or serve a particular purpose.

Overall, the errors in the erroneous sentence are mainly related to verb choice, word order, and clarity of meaning.
cleaned: 1. "Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers" -> "The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers"
Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."




Error_sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
Correct_sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger ?
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "get" instead of "put":
The erroneous sentence uses the verb "get" in the phrase "get their loved ones in danger", which is incorrect. The correct verb to use in this context is "put", as it means to cause someone or something to be in a particular situation or condition. In this case, it means to cause their loved ones to be in danger.
cleaned: 1. "get" instead of "put":
Label: 1. The phrase "put in danger" is a common expression and the verb does not change. The verb "put" means to cause someone to be in a particular place or position.




Error_sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people .
Correct_sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "lost" instead of "loss":
The erroneous sentence uses the verb "lost" (which means to misplace or be unable to find something) instead of the noun "loss" (which means the act of losing something). In this context, the correct word is "loss" because it refers to the loss of interpersonal skills.

Corrected sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .

Explanation: The error is a simple substitution of a verb for a noun, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
cleaned: 1. "lost" instead of "loss":
Label: 1. The verb "cause" is always followed by a noun, and "lost" is the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed to the noun "loss." 




Error_sentence: These green house gases are the main cause to worldwide global warming which give rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Correct_sentence: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "cause to" -> "cause of": The correct preposition to use in this context is "of", not "to". "Cause to" is not a grammatically correct phrase, whereas "cause of" indicates the relationship between the cause (greenhouse gases) and the effect (worldwide global warming).

2. "gases are" -> "gases is": The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. "Gases" is a plural noun, so it should be paired with a plural verb "are", not "is".

3. "which give rise to" -> "which gives rise to": The subject-verb agreement is incorrect again. "Which" refers to the singular noun "warming", so it should be paired with a singular verb "gives", not "give".

These corrections aim to improve the clarity and grammatical accuracy of the sentence, making it easier to understand the intended meaning.
cleaned: 1. "cause to" -> "cause of": The correct preposition to use in this context is "of", not "to". "Cause to" is not a grammatically correct phrase, whereas "cause of" indicates the relationship between the cause (greenhouse gases) and the effect (worldwide global warming).
Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.




Error_sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
Correct_sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential"

Error: "in" is not needed after "confidential"

Explanation: The word "in" is not necessary after "confidential" because "confidential" is an adjective that modifies the noun "risk". The correct sentence should read "keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential", without the preposition "in".

Corrected sentence: Hence, some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential
cleaned: 1. "Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential"
Label: 1. The statement is confusing two phrases: "keep confidential" and "in confidence." The phrase "keep confidential" is common and is used without variation in wording.




Error_sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have a unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage .
Correct_sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "may have a unhealthy baby" -> "may have an unhealthy baby"
Error: Missing indefinite article "an" before the adjective "unhealthy". In English, when the adjective begins with a vowel sound, we use the indefinite article "an" instead of "a".

2. "may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage"
-> "may cause the death of the baby or the end of their marriage"
Error: Missing definite article "the" before the noun "end". In English, when referring to a specific, previously mentioned noun, we use the definite article "the" instead of omitting it. In this case, "end" is referring to a specific end, which is the end of their marriage, so the definite article "the" is necessary.
cleaned: 1. "may have a unhealthy baby" -> "may have an unhealthy baby"
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".




Error_sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .
Correct_sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation , particularly small children who are studying in nursery .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "in particularly" -> "particularly":
Error: Incorrect use of preposition.
Explanation: "In" is not the correct preposition to use before the adverb "particularly". The correct preposition is "particularly" itself, which is used to indicate a specific aspect or characteristic.

Corrected sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation, particularly...

2. "for the small children" -> "small children":
Error: Unnecessary word.
Explanation: The word "for" is not necessary in this context, as "small children" is already a descriptive phrase modifying the noun "children". Removing the unnecessary word makes the sentence more concise and clear.

Corrected sentence: ...particularly small children who are studying in nursery.
cleaned: 1. "in particularly" -> "particularly":
Label: 1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.
2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own.
3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.




Error_sentence: According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .
Correct_sentence: According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes , which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. **Error:** "to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes which are"
**Correction:** "to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes , which are"
**Explanation:** The error is a missing comma after the phrase "five basic design processes". The corrected sentence uses a comma to separate the independent clause "to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes" from the dependent clause "which are defining the problem, gathering pertinent information, generating possible solutions, analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it". This comma helps to clarify the sentence structure and improve readability.

That's the only error in the sentence!
cleaned: 1. **Error:** "to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes which are"
Label: 1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.




Error_sentence: Personally I feel more at ease on social medias .
Correct_sentence: Personally I feel more at ease on social media .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "medias" instead of "media":
The error is a plural form mistake. "Media" is a singular noun, referring to a medium of communication, such as television, radio, or the internet. The correct form is "social media", which is a compound noun referring to the collective platforms of social networking.
cleaned: 1. "medias" instead of "media":
Label: 1. "Media" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralised.




Error_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .
Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "contacts" -> "contact": The error is a plural noun error. The correct sentence uses the singular form "contact" instead of the plural form "contacts". This is because "face-to-face human contact" refers to a single instance of interaction, not multiple instances.

Corrected sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decreased.

Note: I also corrected "decresed" to "decreased", as "decresed" is not a valid word in English.
cleaned: 1. "contacts" -> "contact": The error is a plural noun error. The correct sentence uses the singular form "contact" instead of the plural form "contacts". This is because "face-to-face human contact" refers to a single instance of interaction, not multiple instances.
Label: 1. "Contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. When used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.




Error_sentence: Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Correct_sentence: Also , according to research , it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "a research" -> "research"
	* Error: Missing article "the" before the noun "research". In English, when referring to a specific, previously mentioned noun, we use the definite article "the". In this case, since "research" is not previously mentioned, we use the indefinite article "a" instead.
2. "Facebook and this" -> "Facebook"
	* Error: Unnecessary phrase "and this". The sentence is already complete, and adding "and this" makes it sound awkward. We can simply remove it to make the sentence more concise.

These two errors are minor, but they can affect the clarity and flow of the sentence.
cleaned: 1. "a research" -> "research"
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.




Error_sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Correct_sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook ."

Error: Missing conjunction "and" between "him or her" and "just communicate with friends on facebook".

Explanation: The correct sentence uses the conjunction "and" to connect the two clauses, making the sentence flow smoothly and clearly. The erroneous sentence omits this conjunction, making the sentence sound abrupt and unclear.

Corrected sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .
cleaned: 1. "In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook ."
Label: 1. "But" should be used in the situation where you do one thing, but not the other, so you could say, "they don't speak to the people around them, but do communicate with friends on Facebook," but in the context of your sentence, you are saying that both these actions are going on at the same time, so you should use "and", as in they shun/ignore the people around them AND only communicate with friends on Facebook.




Error_sentence: A family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .
Correct_sentence: A family of four having dinner in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "diners" -> "dinner": The error is a plural noun ("diners") instead of a singular noun ("dinner"). The correct sentence uses the singular form "dinner" to refer to a single meal.

2. "display screen" -> "phone screen" (implied, but not explicitly stated): The error is the lack of specificity about the type of display screen being referred to. In the correct sentence, it is implied that the display screen is a phone screen, but it could be any type of screen.
cleaned: 1. "diners" -> "dinner": The error is a plural noun ("diners") instead of a singular noun ("dinner"). The correct sentence uses the singular form "dinner" to refer to a single meal.
Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner. A meal is still referred to in the singular when it is shared by multiple people. Therefore, it should be "having dinner" rather than "having dinners."




Error_sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma .
Correct_sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "dilemma" should be "dilemmas":
The error is a pluralization mistake. The word "dilemma" refers to a single situation where a person is faced with a difficult choice or problem. In this sentence, the subject "rise" is singular, so the verb "would avoid" should be followed by the plural form "dilemmas" to agree with the subject.
cleaned: 1. "dilemma" should be "dilemmas":
Label: 1. This is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. It should be the plural "dilemmas" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential ethical issues. 




Error_sentence: If your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Correct_sentence: If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "give birth" should be "gives birth":
	* The verb "give" is in the present tense, but it should be in the third person singular form "gives" to agree with the subject "wife".
2. No other errors were found in the sentence.

So, the corrected sentence is: "If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth to the baby, it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well."
cleaned: 1. "give birth" should be "gives birth":
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "gives" to go with "wife".




Error_sentence: With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network site now become a place to show off .
Correct_sentence: With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network sites now become a place to show off .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network site now become a place to show off ."

Error: "site" should be "sites"

Explanation: The error is a simple typo. The correct word is "sites", which is the plural form of "site", indicating multiple social network platforms. The singular form "site" is incorrect in this context.

Corrected sentence: "With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network sites now become a place to show off ."

Let me know if you'd like me to help with anything else!
cleaned: 1. "With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network site now become a place to show off ."
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about social network sites in general, so "site" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .
Correct_sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "hard time" -> "hard times":
The error is a pluralization mistake. "Time" is a singular noun, but in this context, it refers to multiple difficult periods or situations. To correct this, we change "time" to "times", which is the plural form of the noun.

So, the corrected sentence is: "It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times."
cleaned: 1. "hard time" -> "hard times":
Label: 1. When generally referring to a period of hardship, time is pluralised, so the correct expression is "the hard times".




Error_sentence: It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected .
Correct_sentence: It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skills will be badly affected .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "on the internet" should be "chatting on the internet":
	* The phrase "on the internet" is a prepositional phrase that is not necessary in this sentence. The verb "spend" already indicates that the time is being spent online. The corrected phrase "chatting on the internet" is a gerund phrase that functions as a noun, making the sentence more concise and clear.
2. "such that" is not necessary:
	* The phrase "such that" is a subordinating conjunction that is used to introduce a dependent clause. However, in this sentence, the dependent clause "such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected" is not necessary to complete the meaning of the sentence. The sentence still makes sense without it, and the phrase "such that" can be removed without affecting the overall meaning.
3. "will be" is not necessary:
	* The verb "will be" is a future tense auxiliary verb that is not necessary in this sentence. The sentence is already in the future tense with the verb "will make", so the auxiliary verb "will be" is redundant and can be removed.
4. "interpersonal skill" should be "
cleaned: 1. "on the internet" should be "chatting on the internet":
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".
2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct_sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "rely the" should be "rely on":
	* The error is a preposition mistake. "The" is a definite article, and it doesn't make sense to use it as a preposition. The correct preposition to use in this context is "on", which indicates reliance or dependence.
2. "parent" should be "parents":
	* The error is a noun mistake. The subject of the sentence is "children", which implies that there are multiple parents. Therefore, the correct noun to use is the plural form "parents", not the singular form "parent".

By correcting these errors, the sentence becomes grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning: "The children rely on their parents to live".
cleaned: 1. "rely the" should be "rely on":
Label: 1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
2. The subject is "children," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.




Error_sentence: This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
Correct_sentence: This could lead to psychological implications and thus cause many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "causing" -> "cause":
The error is a verb tense inconsistency. The sentence starts with "could lead" in the future tense, and then switches to "causing" which is in the present tense. To maintain consistency, the correct verb form should be "cause" to match the future tense of "could lead".

Corrected sentence: This could lead to psychological implications and thus cause many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society.

Explanation: The error is a verb tense inconsistency. The sentence starts with "could lead" in the future tense, and then switches to "causing" which is in the present tense.
cleaned: 1. "causing" -> "cause":
Label: 1. This sentence is not talking about something that is currently happening, but something that could happen, so you need to change the present continuous "causing" to the present "cause".




Error_sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Correct_sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "manufacture" should be "manufacturing" or simply "a manufacturing company". The error is a typo, where the word "manufacture" is used instead of the correct word "manufacturing" or "a manufacturing company" to refer to a company that produces goods.

Corrected sentence: So, the manufacturing company...

2. There is no error in this part of the sentence.

3. "the innovators are working for" should be "innovators are working for". The error is a missing article ("the") before the noun "innovators". The correct sentence uses the indefinite article "a" instead of the definite article "the" because "innovators" is a plural noun that is not previously mentioned in the sentence.

Corrected sentence: ...the company that innovators are working for...

Note: There is no error in the rest of the sentence.
cleaned: 1. "manufacture" should be "manufacturing" or simply "a manufacturing company". The error is a typo, where the word "manufacture" is used instead of the correct word "manufacturing" or "a manufacturing company" to refer to a company that produces goods.
Label: 1. The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of to innovators in general.




Error_sentence: Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family .
Correct_sentence: Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden in her family .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "a lots" -> "a lot": The error is a typo. "Lots" is a plural noun, whereas "a lot" is a singular noun phrase meaning a large quantity. The correct sentence uses the singular form "a lot" to indicate a single large amount of money.

Corrected sentence: Furthermore, as it could incur spending a lot of money for the treatment...

2. "the burden in her family" -> "a burden in her family": The error is a mistake in article usage. "The" is used to refer to a specific, previously mentioned noun, whereas "a" is used to refer to a non-specific noun. In this case, "burden" is a non-specific noun, so the correct sentence uses the indefinite article "a" instead of "the".

Corrected sentence: Furthermore, as it could incur spending a lot of money for the treatment, the carrier might not want to be a burden in her family.
cleaned: 1. "a lots" -> "a lot": The error is a typo. "Lots" is a plural noun, whereas "a lot" is a singular noun phrase meaning a large quantity. The correct sentence uses the singular form "a lot" to indicate a single large amount of money.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."




Error_sentence: I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .
Correct_sentence: I noticed a real story in newspaper years ago .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "on" instead of "in":
The erroneous sentence uses "on" instead of "in" to describe the location of the story. In this context, "in" is the correct preposition to use because it indicates that the story was published within the newspaper, whereas "on" would imply that the story was published on the surface of the newspaper.
cleaned: 1. "on" instead of "in":
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".




Error_sentence: Looking at this third step we realize why the second stage of an engineering design process of gathering information is important.Once all the information is put together into the different possible solutions , the engineer is put to decide which method out of the lot is suited best for the purpose and if agrees with existing international laws .
Correct_sentence: Looking at this third step we realize why the second stage of an engineering design process of gathering information is important.Once all the information is put together into the different possible solutions , the engineer is put to decide which method out of the lot is suited best for the purpose and agrees with existing international laws .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "if agrees with existing international laws" -> "and agrees with existing international laws"

Error: Missing conjunction "and" between two independent clauses. The correct sentence uses "and" to connect the two clauses, making the sentence grammatically correct and easier to read.

Corrected sentence: ...the engineer is put to decide which method out of the lot is suited best for the purpose and agrees with existing international laws.
cleaned: 1. "if agrees with existing international laws" -> "and agrees with existing international laws"
Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.




Error_sentence: These are not the only challenges that the innovators are going to deal with .
Correct_sentence: These are not the only challenges that innovators are going to deal with .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "the innovators" -> "innovators"

Error: Unnecessary definite article ("the")

Explanation: The definite article "the" is not needed before the noun "innovators" because it is a common noun and not a specific, previously mentioned noun. In this case, using "innovators" alone is sufficient and more concise.
cleaned: 1. "the innovators" -> "innovators"
Label: 1. The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of to innovators in general.




Error_sentence: This is the common law in the society .
Correct_sentence: This is the common law in society .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "in the society" -> "in society"

Error: Unnecessary word "the" is used.

Explanation: In the original sentence, the phrase "in the society" is incorrect because "the" is not necessary to specify which society is being referred to. In English, when referring to a general or common society, we typically use the phrase "in society" without the definite article "the".
cleaned: 1. "in the society" -> "in society"
Label: 1. As "society" is something general and uncountable, it does not need an article, so remove "the".




Error_sentence: When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
Correct_sentence: When people around us know that we got a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , whether caring for us too much or keeping away from us .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "got certain disease" -> "got a certain disease":
	* Error: Missing article "a" before the noun "certain disease".
	* Explanation: The correct sentence uses the indefinite article "a" to indicate that the disease is a specific, but unspecified, one. Without the article, the sentence sounds awkward and unclear.
2. "altitudes" -> "attitudes":
	* Error: Incorrect word choice.
	* Explanation: The correct sentence uses the word "attitudes", which refers to a person's feelings or opinions towards something. "Altitudes", on the other hand, refers to the height or elevation of something. In this context, "attitudes" is the correct choice.
3. "caring us" -> "caring for us":
	* Error: Incorrect preposition.
	* Explanation: The correct sentence uses the preposition "for" to indicate the object of the verb "caring". "For" is the correct choice because it indicates the purpose or beneficiary of the caring action. "Us" is the object of the verb, and "for" is the preposition that indicates the relationship between the subject and the object.
4. No
cleaned: 1. "got certain disease" -> "got a certain disease":
Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.




Error_sentence: Therefore , considering the people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , considering people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "the people 's" -> "people's": The error is a possessive form issue. In English, when a noun is possessive, it is marked with an apostrophe followed by the letter "s" (e.g., "people's"). In the erroneous sentence, the apostrophe is misplaced, making it "the people 's" instead of "people's".

2. No error: The erroneous sentence does not contain any errors in this part.

3. "a know" -> "a known": The error is a word choice issue. "Know" is a verb, whereas "known" is an adjective. In this context, "known" is the correct word to use, as it describes the type of genetic risk.

4. No error: The erroneous sentence does not contain any errors in this part.

5. No error: The erroneous sentence does not contain any errors in this part.

6. No error: The erroneous sentence does not contain any errors in this part.

7. No error: The erroneous sentence does not contain any errors in this part.

8. No error: The erroneous sentence does not contain any errors in this part.

9. No error: The
cleaned: 1. "the people 's" -> "people's": The error is a possessive form issue. In English, when a noun is possessive, it is marked with an apostrophe followed by the letter "s" (e.g., "people's"). In the erroneous sentence, the apostrophe is misplaced, making it "the people 's" instead of "people's".
Label: 1. The sentence is talking about people in general, so it does not need an article.




Error_sentence: Otherwise , making it an obligation will restric the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
Correct_sentence: Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "restric" instead of "restrict":
The error is a typo, where the correct word "restrict" is replaced with a similar-sounding but incorrect word "restric". The correct word "restrict" means to limit or hinder something, whereas "restric" is not a valid word in English.

2. No error found:
The rest of the sentence is correct, with no other errors in grammar, spelling, or punctuation.
cleaned: 1. "restric" instead of "restrict":
Label: 1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "restrict".




Error_sentence: With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status .
Correct_sentence: With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and statuses .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "status" -> "statuses":
The error is a plural form mistake. The correct word is "statuses" because it refers to multiple statuses, whereas "status" would refer to a single status.
cleaned: 1. "status" -> "statuses":
Label: 1. The list is talking about things in general, and so "status" should be pluralised to match "conversations", "blogs" and "photos".




Error_sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .
Correct_sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay for another year in the secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top student in his province .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "another year in secondary school" -> "for another year in the secondary school"

Error: Missing article "the" before "secondary school".

Explanation: The correct sentence uses the article "the" to refer to the specific secondary school, whereas the erroneous sentence omits it, making the sentence unclear.

2. None (no other errors found)

The corrected sentence is identical to the erroneous sentence except for the corrected phrase mentioned above.
cleaned: 1. "another year in secondary school" -> "for another year in the secondary school"
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.




Error_sentence: These implants and products are also been used as surveillance tools .
Correct_sentence: These implants and products have also been used as surveillance tools .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "are" -> "have":
The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The subject of the sentence is "implants and products", which is a plural noun, so the verb "have" (in the present perfect tense) is needed instead of "are".
cleaned: 1. "are" -> "have":
Label: 1. The perfect present tense should be used to show that the action of using implants and products is currently still happening. To create the perfect present, we use "have" and the past participle "used." 




Error_sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .
Correct_sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring some negative effects on our daily lives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "bring in" -> "bring": The phrase "bring in" is not grammatically correct in this context. Instead, we use the verb "bring" to indicate the introduction or occurrence of something. So, the correct phrase is "bring some negative effects".

Explanation: The error is a result of a misplaced preposition. The correct phrase should be "bring" instead of "bring in".

2. "negative effect" -> "negative effects": The word "effect" is a noun that refers to the result of a particular action or set of circumstances. In this sentence, we are talking about multiple negative outcomes, so we use the plural form "effects" instead of the singular form "effect".

Explanation: The error is a result of a lack of understanding of the difference between the singular and plural forms of the word "effect".
cleaned: 1. "bring in" -> "bring": The phrase "bring in" is not grammatically correct in this context. Instead, we use the verb "bring" to indicate the introduction or occurrence of something. So, the correct phrase is "bring some negative effects".
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
3. This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .
Correct_sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "almost immediate" -> "almost immediately":
	* Error: The phrase "almost immediate" is incorrect because "immediate" is an adjective that means happening or done without delay, whereas "almost" is an adverb that means very nearly or almost, but not quite. To convey the intended meaning, we need to use the adverb "almost" with the adjective "immediate", resulting in "almost immediately".
	* Explanation: The corrected phrase "almost immediately" conveys the idea that the dissemination of information happens very quickly, but not instantaneously.

The corrected sentence is: Hence, social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them.
cleaned: 1. "almost immediate" -> "almost immediately":
Label: 1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".




Error_sentence: With the aids of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily .
Correct_sentence: With the aid of social media , people bond globally , information flows rapidly , and humans live happily .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "aids" -> "aid": The error is a plural noun error. "Aid" is a singular noun, and the correct phrase is "with the aid of social media", not "with the aids of social media". The correct sentence uses the singular form "aid" to refer to the help or assistance provided by social media.

2. "bonds" -> "bond": The error is a verb error. "Bond" is a verb that means to form a close relationship or connection, and the correct sentence uses the verb "bond" in the singular form to describe the action of forming connections globally.

3. (No error): The sentence "information flows rapidly" is correct and does not contain any errors.

4. "human lives" -> "humans live": The error is a phrase error. The correct sentence uses the phrase "humans live" to describe the state of happiness, whereas the erroneous sentence uses the phrase "human lives" which is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase "humans live" is more idiomatic and natural in this context.
cleaned: 1. "aids" -> "aid": The error is a plural noun error. "Aid" is a singular noun, and the correct phrase is "with the aid of social media", not "with the aids of social media". The correct sentence uses the singular form "aid" to refer to the help or assistance provided by social media.
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "bond" to go with "people".
2. This sentence is talking about humans in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "live" to go with "humans".
4. "Aid" used in the sense of help or assistance is an uncountable noun and therefore should not be pluralised.




Error_sentence: We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
Correct_sentence: We can not deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "We can not deny that the genetic testing" -> "We can not deny that genetic testing"

Error: Missing article ("the") before "genetic testing".

Explanation: The article "the" is not necessary before "genetic testing" because it is a general term and not a specific one. However, in this context, the sentence is referring to a specific type of testing, so the article "the" is not needed.

Corrected sentence: We can not deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem.
cleaned: 1. "We can not deny that the genetic testing" -> "We can not deny that genetic testing"
Label: 1. The concept of "genetic testing" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific type or instance of genetic testing, instead of the concept in general.




Error_sentence: Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
Correct_sentence: Family members , as one the closest groups of people from whom they can get comfort , are a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "one the" -> "the one" or "the closest group" (Error: Missing article or incorrect phrase structure)

In the corrected sentence, "the one" is used to indicate that "one" is being used as a singular noun, whereas in the erroneous sentence, "one the" is a phrase that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, "the closest group" could be used to clarify the meaning.

2. "groups of people" -> "group of people" (Error: Pluralization)

The erroneous sentence uses "groups" which is plural, whereas the corrected sentence uses "group" which is singular. Since "family members" is a singular noun, it's more accurate to use "group" instead of "groups".

3. "is" -> "are" (Error: Subject-verb agreement)

The subject of the sentence is "family members", which is a plural noun. Therefore, the verb "are" should be used instead of "is" to agree with the subject.

4. (No error) The rest of the sentence is correct.

Note: There might be other minor errors or suggestions for improvement, but the above explanations highlight the most significant errors in
cleaned: 1. "one the" -> "the one" or "the closest group" (Error: Missing article or incorrect phrase structure)
Label: 1. The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so use the plural "groups".
2. This connects back to "family members" at the beginning of the sentence, so you need to use the plural, "are", as in "Family members are a crucial factor...".

Correct_sentence: However,there are still people against the decision of revealing private information.As in the case of Alzheimer patients,it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who,how and whom will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members ( DementiaToday,2012 ) .There are associations provide helps to Alzheimer patients like Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association,1980 ) .Although there are still thousands of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all help and support from everyone,the need to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult time .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "There are still thousand of genetic risk diseases" -> "There are still thousands of genetic risk diseases"

Error: Missing plural suffix "-s" on the word "thousand". The correct sentence uses the plural form "thousands" to agree with the noun "diseases".

2. "the needs" -> "the need"

Error: The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. The sentence should use the singular form "need" instead of the plural form "needs" because the subject is "the need".

Note: There are no other errors in the sentence. The rest of the sentence is grammatically correct and coherent.
cleaned: 1. "There are still thousand of genetic risk diseases" -> "There are still thousands of genetic risk diseases"
Label: 1. This sentence is not using "thousand" as a specific number, i.e. 1,000, it is using it metaphorically to express a large, unspecified amount. In this case, it should be pluralised as "thousands".
2. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
3. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
4. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.




Error_sentence: It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes .
Correct_sentence: It is also important to use better material that can support buildings during any natural disasters like earthquakes .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "create a better material" -> "use better material":
Error: Incorrect verb choice
Explanation: The verb "create" implies making something new, whereas the correct verb "use" implies selecting or employing something that already exists. In this context, the sentence is talking about using a material that is already available, not creating a new one.

2. "that can support the buildings" -> "that can support buildings":
Error: Incorrect prepositional phrase
Explanation: The prepositional phrase "the buildings" is unnecessary and makes the sentence sound awkward. The correct phrase "buildings" is sufficient to convey the intended meaning.

3. "despite any natural disaster" -> "during any natural disasters":
Error: Incorrect preposition and word choice
Explanation: The preposition "despite" implies a contrast or opposition, whereas the correct preposition "during" implies a simultaneous occurrence. Additionally, the word "disasters" is a plural noun, so it agrees with the plural noun "natural disasters".
cleaned: 1. "create a better material" -> "use better material":
Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.




Error_sentence: The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Correct_sentence: The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic devices until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. "device" -> "devices":
The error is a plural noun error. The correct sentence uses the plural form "devices" to refer to multiple electronic devices, whereas the erroneous sentence uses the singular form "device". This is because "devices" is the correct plural form of the noun "device".

Explanation: The error is due to a lack of attention to the plural form of the noun "device".
cleaned: 1. "device" -> "devices":
Label: 1. Auto-correct is a feature that is common to many different electronic devices, so the plural "devices" should be used. The singular "device" is used to refer to individual devices, with "a device" meaning any device and "the device" meaning one specific device.
