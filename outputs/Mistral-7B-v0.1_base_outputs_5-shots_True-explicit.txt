Error_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Prediction: 
1. "Qualified" is an adjective, not a noun.
2. "Human resource" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
Erroneous sentence: For example , the number of patents filed in China has increased from 200,000 in 2000 to 1,000,000 in 2010 .
Correct sentence: For example , the number of patents filed in China has increased from 200,000 in 2000 to 1,000,000 in 2010 .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error:  , Correction: to
Explanations:
1. "Patents" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. Missing word. The correct expression is "increased to".
Erroneous sentence: This is due to the fact that China has become the world's second largest economy .
Correct sentence: This is due to the fact that China has become the world's second largest economy .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: largest, Correction: second largest
Explanations:
1. "Economy" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. "Largest" is an adjective, not a noun.
cleaned: 1. "Qualified" is an adjective, not a noun.
2. "Human resource" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle. 




Error_sentence: On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Correct_sentence: On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Prediction: 
1. "On the other side" is an idiom that means "on the other hand".
2. The sentence is talking about a single person, so use the singular "wants" instead of the plural "want".
Erroneous sentence: In addition , genetic testing can also be done by family members .
Correct sentence: In addition , genetic testing can also be done by family members .
Errors:
1. Error: can, Correction: can be done
Explanations:
1. The sentence is saying that genetic testing can be done by family members, so use "can be done" instead of "can".
Erroneous sentence: Genetic testing can be done by family members , friends , and relatives .
Correct sentence: Genetic testing can be done by family members , friends , and relatives .
Errors:
1. Error: can, Correction: can be done
Explanations:
1. The sentence is saying that genetic testing can be done by family members, friends, and relatives, so use "can be done" instead of "can".
cleaned: 1. "On the other side" is an idiom that means "on the other hand".
2. The sentence is talking about a single person, so use the singular "wants" instead of the plural "want".
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Error_sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct_sentence: One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .
Prediction: 
1. This is a countable noun, so it should be made plural.
2. This sentence is talking about disadvantages in general, so "the" should be removed.
3. This sentence is talking about people losing interest in face-to-face communication in general, so "of" should be replaced with "in".
Erroneous sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people .
Correct sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
Errors:
1. Error: lost, Correction: loss
Explanations:
1. The verb "cause" is always followed by a noun, and "lost" is the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed to the noun "loss."
Erroneous sentence: Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
Correct sentence: Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences .
Errors:
1. Error: shwing, Correction: showing
2. Error: experience, Correction: experiences
Explanations:
1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."
2. The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.
cleaned: 1. This is a countable noun, so it should be made plural.
2. This sentence is talking about disadvantages in general, so "the" should be removed.
3. This sentence is talking about people losing interest in face-to-face communication in general, so "of" should be replaced with "in".
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.




Error_sentence: I agree that RFID technology shall not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
Correct_sentence: I agree that RFID technology should not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
Prediction: 
1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.
cleaned: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.

Error_sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Correct_sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Prediction: 
1. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the purpose or reason for an action. In this case, the social media sites are leaking users' information to companies for the purpose of receiving cash reimbursement.
Erroneous sentence: Social media has become an important part of people's lives .
Correct sentence: Social media has become an important part of people's lives .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: of
Explanations:
1. The phrase "an important part of people's lives" is grammatically correct, but it doesn't make sense. "Social media" is not a part of people's lives; rather, it is something that people use as a part of their lives. The phrase "an important part of people's lives" can be rephrased as "a part of people's lives that is important."
Erroneous sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Correct sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Errors:
1. Error: with, Correction: for
Explanations:
1. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the purpose or reason for an action. In this case, the social media sites are leaking users' information to companies for the purpose of receiving cash reimbursement.
Erroneous sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Correct sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spending too much time on the internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Errors:
1. Error: spend, Correction: spending
2. Error:  , Correction: the
Explanations:
1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.
cleaned: 1. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the purpose or reason for an action. In this case, the social media sites are leaking users' information to companies for the purpose of receiving cash reimbursement.
Label: 1. The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.




Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Prediction: 
1. The plural noun "researches" refers to multiple pieces of research. The singular noun "research" refers to a single piece of research.
2. The verb "show" is in the third-person singular form. It should be changed to the third-person plural form, "show."
Erroneous sentence: For example , in the 1990 's , there was an invention of the internet .
Correct sentence: For example , in the 1990's , there was an invention of the internet .
Errors:
1. Error: 1990 's, Correction: 1990's
Explanations:
1. The apostrophe in "1990's" indicates that "1990's" is a contraction of "1990's." A contraction is a shortened form of a word or phrase. In this case, "1990's" is a shortened form of "1990's."
Erroneous sentence: The invention of the internet is a technology that has changed the way people communicate with each other .
Correct sentence: The invention of the internet is a technology that has changed the way people communicate with each other .
Errors:
1. Error: The, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The definite article "the" can imply a comparison. The phrase "the invention of the internet" implies the existence of other inventions, such as the invention of the telephone or the invention of the automobile, and marks "the invention of the internet" as being distinct from those other inventions.
cleaned: 1. The plural noun "researches" refers to multiple pieces of research. The singular noun "research" refers to a single piece of research.
2. The verb "show" is in the third-person singular form. It should be changed to the third-person plural form, "show."
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Correct_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason for the halt of the work was that the higher level authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the halt of the work) with regard to whom (the higher level authorities).
2. When used in the context of "reason", "reason" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
3. When used in the context of "reason", "reason" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
4. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the halt of the work) with regard to whom (the higher level authorities).
Erroneous sentence: The reason why the underground traffic system was halted was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Correct sentence: The reason why the underground traffic system was halted was that the higher level authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Errors:
1. Error: of, Correction:  
2. Error:  , Correction: the
3. Error: of, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the halt of the work) with regard to whom (the higher level authorities).
2. When used in the context of "reason", "reason" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the halt of the work) with regard to whom (the higher level authorities).
cleaned: 1. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the halt of the work) with regard to whom (the higher level authorities).
2. When used in the context of "reason", "reason" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
3. When used in the context of "reason", "reason" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
4. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the halt of the work) with regard to whom (the higher level authorities).
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.




Error_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Correct_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Prediction: 
1. "Polices" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she polices social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about "police" as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "police".
Erroneous sentence: For example , the percentage of the population in Singapore that is addicted to social media sites is 1000 times lesser than the percentage of the population in China that is addicted to social media sites .
Correct sentence: For example , the percentage of the population in Singapore that is addicted to social media sites is 1000 times less than the percentage of the population in China that is addicted to social media sites .
Errors:
1. Error: lesser, Correction: less
2. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "percentage," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.
cleaned: 1. "Polices" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she polices social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about "police" as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "police".
Label: 1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".

Erroneous sentence: However , this is not always the case .
Correct sentence: However , this is not always the case .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: the
Explanations:
1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article.

It is usually "it is important to note," but sometimes "that is important to note," referring to a specific note that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another note.

cleaned: 1. The phrase "come into contact with" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the verb "come" in the infinitive form.

Error_sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct_sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Prediction: 
1. The preposition "on" is used to indicate that the children are dependent on the parents for their livelihood.
2. The noun "parents" is used to refer to both the father and the mother, while "parent" is used to refer to either the father or the mother individually.

2. The noun "parents" is used to refer to both the father and the mother, while "parent" is used to refer to either the father or the mother individually.
Label: 1. Missing word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. This sentence is either referring to the parents of specific children, or parents and children in general, but either way, "parents" should be pluralised.

Correct_sentence: To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "put it in a nutshell" is an idiomatic expression that means to summarize something in a concise manner. In this case, the speaker is summarizing their belief that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health. Therefore, the phrase "in the nutshell" should be changed to "in a nutshell."
Erroneous sentence: However , it is important to note that there are some drawbacks of genetic testing as well .
Correct sentence: However , it is important to note that there are some drawbacks to genetic testing as well .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: to

In this case, the speaker is summarizing their belief that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health. Therefore, the phrase "in the nutshell" should be changed to "in a nutshell."
Label: 1. "In a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. The phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but the specificity of "the" makes it sound literal. Instead of referring figuratively to something very simple, it would mean something that is literally inside a nutshell.

Errors:
1. Error: thousand, Correction: thousands
2. Error: helps, Correction: help
3. Error: supports, Correction: support
4. Error: needs, Correction: need
Explanations:
1. This sentence is not using "thousand" as a specific number, i.e. 1,000, it is using it metaphorically to express a large, unspecified amount. In this case, it should be pluralised as "thousands".
2. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
3. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.

cleaned: 1. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
Label: 1. The sentence is discussing add-ons in general, so "add-on" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .
Correct_sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .
Prediction: 
1. The conjunction "however" is used to introduce a contrasting idea. In this sentence, the contrasting idea is that the more people use it on us, the more power they will have over us.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "People" is the third person plural, so use "use" to correspond with it.
3. Incorrect conjugation. "People" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
4. Incorrect conjugation. "People" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
5. Incorrect conjugation. "People" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
6. Incorrect conjugation. "People" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.

7. Incorrect conjugation. "People" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
8. Incorrect conjugation. "People" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.




Error_sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .
Correct_sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child .
Prediction: 
1. The possessive pronoun "their" is used to refer to something belonging to more than one person, but in this case, it is referring to something belonging to a single person, so "the" should be used instead.
Erroneous sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenges for the innovators .
Correct sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenge for the innovators .
Errors:
1. Error: challenges, Correction: challenge
Explanations:
1. The pronoun "another" means "one more," so it is singular and cannot be used with the plural "challenges." The singular "challenge" should be used instead.
Erroneous sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .
Correct sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers from making more effort to do research and design , and they have little motivation to work hard .
Errors:
1. Error: to make, Correction: from making
2. Error: for, Correction:  
3. Error: will, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is an archaic way of saying "make a demoralizing remark to someone," which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."
cleaned: 1. The possessive pronoun "their" is used to refer to something belonging to more than one person, but in this case, it is referring to something belonging to a single person, so "the" should be used instead.
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".




Error_sentence: Overall , I belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
Correct_sentence: Overall , I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "believes" to go with "I".
Erroneous sentence: In my opinion , I think that social media is a double-edged sword .
Correct sentence: In my opinion , I think that social media is a double-edged sword .
Errors:
1. Error: I think, Correction: I believe

Erroneous sentence: I think that social media is a double-edged sword .
Correct sentence: I believe that social media is a double-edged sword .
Errors:
1. Error: I think, Correction: I believe
Explanations:
1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "believes" to go with "I".
cleaned: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "believes" to go with "I".
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "believe."




Error_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .
Correct_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers from making more effort to do research and design , and they have little motivation to work hard .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "make more effort" is a collocation, and "to make more effort" is not used. The preposition "from" is used to indicate that the engineers are discouraged from making more effort to do research and design.
2. The conjunction "and" is used to indicate that the engineers are discouraged from making more effort to do research and design and that they have little motivation to work hard. The conjunction "for" is used to indicate that the engineers are discouraged from making more effort to do research and design because they will have little motivation to work hard.
3. The phrase "have little motivation" is a collocation, and "will have little motivation" is not used. The phrase "have little motivation" is used to indicate that the engineers have little motivation to work hard. The phrase "will have little motivation" is used to indicate that the engineers will have little motivation to work hard in the future.
Erroneous sentence: It was found that there were 10,000 workers in the factory .
Correct sentence: It was found that there were 10,000 workers in the factory .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: the
Explanations:
1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific number of workers in a specific factory, so the definite article is necessary.
Erroneous sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about others .
Correct sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has knowledge about others .
Errors:
1. Error: a, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. "Knowledge" is an uncountable and abstract noun, so it cannot be made singular or plural, thus it cannot be used with the indefinite article 'a.'
cleaned: 1. The phrase "make more effort" is a collocation, and "to make more effort" is not used. The preposition "from" is used to indicate that the engineers are discouraged from making more effort to do research and design.
2. The conjunction "and" is used to indicate that the engineers are discouraged from making more effort to do research and design and that they have little motivation to work hard. The conjunction "for" is used to indicate that the engineers are discouraged from making more effort to do research and design because they will have little motivation to work hard.
3. The phrase "have little motivation" is a collocation, and "will have little motivation" is not used. The phrase "have little motivation" is used to indicate that the engineers have little motivation to work hard. The phrase "will have little motivation" is used to indicate that the engineers will have little motivation to work hard in the future.
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."




Error_sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other 's permission , this should not be placed or implanted to anyone .
Correct_sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without permission , this technology should not be placed or implanted in anyone .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "without other 's permission" is redundant and should be removed.
2. The phrase "this should not be placed or implanted to anyone" should be changed to "this technology should not be placed or implanted in anyone."
3. The phrase "to anyone" should be changed to "in anyone."
Erroneous sentence: These implants and products are also been used as surveillance tools .
Correct sentence: These implants and products have also been used as surveillance tools .
Errors:
1. Error: are, Correction: have
Explanations:
1. The perfect present tense should be used to show that the action of using implants and products is currently still happening. To create the perfect present, we use "have" and the past participle "used." 
Erroneous sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than five percent of the population in the China .
Correct sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than five percent of the population in China .
Errors:
1. Error: lesser, Correction: less
2. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.
Erroneous sentence: Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .
Correct sentence: Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or afraid of .
Errors:
1. Error: be, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The first "be" in the sentence can be used for both "shy" and "afraid", you do not need to repeat it for "afraid".
Erroneous sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other 's permission , this should not be placed or
cleaned: 1. The phrase "without other 's permission" is redundant and should be removed.
2. The phrase "this should not be placed or implanted to anyone" should be changed to "this technology should not be placed or implanted in anyone."
3. The phrase "to anyone" should be changed to "in anyone."
Label: 1. As "permission" is something granted by another person, this is already taken for granted without needing to explicitly say "other's". 
2. You should explicitly state "technology" for clarity.
3. An implant goes inside the body, so you need to use "in" accordingly.




Error_sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .
Correct_sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one year ago,when I just arrived singapore .
Prediction: 
1. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "one years" refers to one year. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
Erroneous sentence: It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes .
Correct sentence: It is also important to use better material that can support buildings during any natural disasters like earthquakes .
Errors:
1. Error: create, Correction: use
2. Error: a, Correction:  
3. Error: the, Correction:  
4. Error: despite, Correction: during
5. Error: disaster, Correction: disasters
Explanations:
1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters
cleaned: 1. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "one years" refers to one year. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
Label: 1. The phrase "one year" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "years," so it should be the singular "year."




Error_sentence: Therefore , I thought a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Prediction: 
1. The subject here is the singular "I," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "think."
Erroneous sentence: Therefore , I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .
Correct sentence: Therefore , I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child .
Errors:
1. Error: their, Correction: the
Explanations:
1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right."
Erroneous sentence: In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Correct sentence: In past decades , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: are, Correction: were
3. Error: connect, Correction: connected
4. Error: live, Correction: lived
Explanations:
1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense
cleaned: 1. The subject here is the singular "I," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "think."
Label: 1. You are expressing an opinion that you hold now, not something that you thought in the past, so you should use the present tense, "think".




Error_sentence: Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies for spying and advertising .
Correct_sentence: Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transferred to the companies for spying and advertising .
Prediction: 
1. "Transfer" is the process of moving something from one place to another, as in "I transferred my money from my savings account to my checking account", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "transferred" on its own.
Erroneous sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .
Correct sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring some negative effects on our daily lives .
Errors:
1. Error: in, Correction:  
2. Error: life, Correction: lives
3. Error: effect, Correction: effects
Explanations:
1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
3. This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Correct sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Errors:
1. Error: polices, Correction: police
Explanations:
1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".
Erroneous sentence: To put it in the nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Correct sentence: To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction: a
Explanations:
1. "In a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. The phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but
cleaned: 1. "Transfer" is the process of moving something from one place to another, as in "I transferred my money from my savings account to my checking account", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "transferred" on its own.
Label: 1. This is the passive voice, continuing from the phrase "is recorded." The passive voice requires a form of the verb "to be" followed by a secondary verb, which is always the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "transfer" to the past participle "transferred."




Error_sentence: Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
Correct_sentence: Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences .
Prediction: 
1. "Shwing" is not a word.

1. Error: healthiness, Correction: health
Explanations:
1. "Healthiness" is not a word.
cleaned: 1. "Shwing" is not a word.
2. The sentence is talking about multiple experiences, so "experience" should be pluralised to "experiences".
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."
2. The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.

Error_sentence: However , since internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Correct_sentence: However , since the internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .

I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.




Error_sentence: That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
Correct_sentence: That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
Prediction: 
1. The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Correct sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .
Errors:
1. Error: but, Correction: and
Explanations:
1. "But" should be used in the situation where you do one thing, but not the other, so you could say, "they don't speak to the people around them, but do communicate with friends on Facebook," but in the context of your sentence, you are saying that both these actions are going on at the same time, so you should use "and", as in they shun/ignore the people around them AND only communicate with friends on Facebook.
Erroneous sentence: The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .
Correct sentence: The earlier we tell them , the better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .
Errors:
1. Error: a, Correction: the
Explanations:
1. The construction "the earlier A, the better B" is talking about specifics, with a greater focus on B. As such, B requires an article, and as you are talking about something specific, you should use the definite article, "the".
Erroneous sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma .
Correct sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas .
Errors:
1. Error: dilemma, Correction: dilemmas
Explanations:
1. This is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. It should be the plural "dilemmas" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential ethical issues.
cleaned: 1. The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.
Label: 1. The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.




Error_sentence: Since this is happen more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to .
Correct_sentence: Since this happens more often in countries which are much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child without knowing where the child has been brought to .
Prediction: 
1. The verb form should be "happens" for subject-verb agreement's sake.
2. The concept of "countries" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific country, instead of to countries in general.
3. The concept of "countries" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific country, instead of to countries in general.

5. The subject here is the plural "countries," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "are."

4. The verb form should be "are" for subject-verb agreement's sake.
5. The subject here is the plural "countries," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "are."
Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.




Error_sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenges for the innovators .
Correct_sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenge for the innovators .
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "challenge".
cleaned: 1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "challenge".
Label: 1. The pronoun "another" means "one more," so it is singular and cannot be used with the plural "challenges." The singular "challenge" should be used instead.




Error_sentence: In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
Correct_sentence: In addition , privacy issues have become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share in the first place .
Prediction: 
1. The noun "privacy issue" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular privacy issue, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "more popular" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away.

Label: 1. This sentence is talking about privacy issues in general, so "issue" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Privacy issues" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
3. Incorrect word. The correct expression is "in the first place".




Error_sentence: This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .

Prediction: 
1. The phrase "both of his parents has gene A" should be "both of his parents have gene A."
2. The phrase "they are both under high risk of having disease C" should be "they are both at high risk of having disease C."
3. The phrase "they could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C" should be "they could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having disease C."

4. The phrase "runing two separate tests" should be "running two separate tests."
Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.




Error_sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Correct_sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Prediction: 
1. "Generation" here is a noun that goes with "pass down", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "pass down". As a generation can only have one next generation, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".

cleaned: 1. "Generation" here is a noun that goes with "pass down", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "pass down". As a generation can only have one next generation, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".
Label: 1. Missing article. As you are talking specifically about the next generation, use the definite article, "the".

Error_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
Correct_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
Prediction: 
1. The modal verb "shall" is used to express certainty about the future, while the modal verb "should" is used to express an opinion or recommendation about the future. In this sentence, the writer is expressing an opinion or recommendation, so "should" should be used instead of "shall."
2. The preposition "for" is used to express the purpose of something, while the preposition "to" is used to express the destination of something. In this sentence, the writer is expressing that RFID technology should not be available to the public, so "to" should be used instead of "for."
3. The conjunction "and" is used to join two or more words, phrases, or clauses that are of equal importance, while the conjunction "or" is used to join two or more words, phrases, or clauses that are of unequal importance. In this sentence, the writer is expressing that RFID technology should not be available to the public and should not be taken for granted, so "or" should be used instead of "and."
Erroneous sentence: In conclusion , social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationship and make new friends , as well as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
Correct sentence: In conclusion , social media in contemporary society is able to help one improve relationships and make new friends , as well as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: relationship, Correction: relationships
Explanations:
1. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.
2. When referencing relationships as a general concept, the plural "relationships" should be used because it references multiple relationships between many different people. The singular "relationship" is used to refer to individual relationships, with "a relationship" meaning any relationship and "the relationship" meaning one relationship specifically.
cleaned: 1. The modal verb "shall" is used to express certainty about the future, while the modal verb "should" is used to express an opinion or recommendation about the future. In this sentence, the writer is expressing an opinion or recommendation, so "should" should be used instead of "shall."
2. The preposition "for" is used to express the purpose of something, while the preposition "to" is used to express the destination of something. In this sentence, the writer is expressing that RFID technology should not be available to the public, so "to" should be used instead of "for."
3. The conjunction "and" is used to join two or more words, phrases, or clauses that are of equal importance, while the conjunction "or" is used to join two or more words, phrases, or clauses that are of unequal importance. In this sentence, the writer is expressing that RFID technology should not be available to the public and should not be taken for granted, so "or" should be used instead of "and."
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.




Error_sentence: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Correct_sentence: In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees to spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Prediction: 
1. "Corporate world" is an uncountable noun, so you should use "the" before it.
2. "Social media" is a plural noun, so you should use "networks".
3. Incorrect conjugation. "Spend" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she spends his/her office time on his/her personal leisure". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about "spend" as a verb, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable verb, so just use "spending".
Erroneous sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .
Correct sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .
Errors:
1. Error: The, Correction: However , the
2. Error: using, Correction: use
3. Error: over, Correction: on
4. Error: on, Correction: over
Explanations:
1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.
Erroneous sentence: Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
Correct sentence: Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious
cleaned: 1. "Corporate world" is an uncountable noun, so you should use "the" before it.
2. "Social media" is a plural noun, so you should use "networks".
3. Incorrect conjugation. "Spend" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she spends his/her office time on his/her personal leisure". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about "spend" as a verb, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable verb, so just use "spending".
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."




Error_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .
Correct_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used on the social media sites .
Prediction: 
1. The preposition "of" is used when referring to a part of something, such as "of the social media sites." The preposition "in" is used when referring to a location, such as "in the social media sites."
2. The preposition "in" is used when referring to a location, such as "in the social media sites." The preposition "on" is used when referring to a state of connection, such as "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
Erroneous sentence: The use of social media is not only for entertainment but also can be used as a tool to communicate with other people .
Correct sentence: The use of social media is not only for entertainment but also can be used as a tool to communicate with other people .
Errors:
1. Error: but, Correction: and
Explanations:
1. The phrase "not only... but also" is used to contrast two ideas. In this case, the first idea is that social media is used for entertainment, and the second idea is that social media can be used as a tool to communicate with other people. The phrase "not only... but also" contrasts the first idea with the second idea, so "and" should be used instead of "but."
Erroneous sentence: The use of social media is not only for entertainment but also can be used as a tool to communicate with other people .
Correct sentence: The use of social media is not only for entertainment but also can be used as a tool to communicate with other people .
Errors:
1. Error: but, Correction: and
Explanations:
1. The phrase "not only... but also" is used to contrast two ideas. In this case, the first idea is that social media is used for entertainment, and the second idea is that social media can be used as a tool to communicate with other people. The phrase "not only... but also" contrasts the first idea with the second idea, so "and" should be used instead of "but."
cleaned: 1. The preposition "of" is used when referring to a part of something, such as "of the social media sites." The preposition "in" is used when referring to a location, such as "in the social media sites."
2. The preposition "in" is used when referring to a location, such as "in the social media sites." The preposition "on" is used when referring to a state of connection, such as "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Error_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Correct_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "despite of" is incorrect. It should be "despite" or "despite the fact that".
Erroneous sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Correct sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Errors:
1. Error: with, Correction: for
Explanations:
1. The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.
Erroneous sentence: For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Correct sentence: For example , we tend send birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Errors:
1. Error: a, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The indefinite article "a" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "birthday wishes." Either "birthday wishes" or "a birthday wish" would be acceptable.
cleaned: 1. The phrase "despite of" is incorrect. It should be "despite" or "despite the fact that".
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. If you were using "in spite" it would be okay to write "in spite of the distance", but "of" is not necessary when using "despite".




Error_sentence: Therefore , the social media is truly good for people .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , social media is truly good for people .
Prediction: 
1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "The social media" means that this is the only possible type of social media. If there are multiple possible types of social media, it should be "social media," which implies that the type of social media is one of several.
Erroneous sentence: In the end , the most important thing is that the social media is a good thing for people .
Correct sentence: In the end , the most important thing is that social media is a good thing for people .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: is, Correction: is a
Explanations:
1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "The social media" means that this is the only possible type of social media. If there are multiple possible types of social media, it should be "social media," which implies that the type of social media is one of several.
2. I agree that "is" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "is" should be changed to whether.
cleaned: 1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "The social media" means that this is the only possible type of social media. If there are multiple possible types of social media, it should be "social media," which implies that the type of social media is one of several.
Label: 1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

Correct_sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal moral morals the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "morals".
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "nature".
cleaned: 1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "morals".
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "nature".
Label: 1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."

Correct sentence: In conclusion , social media in contemporary society is able to help one improve relationships and make new friends , as well as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
Errors:
1. Error: relationship, Correction: relationships

Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: ,
Explanations:
1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.
cleaned: 1. The indefinite article "a" should not be used before "birthday wishes" because "birthday wishes" is a countable noun.
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "birthday wishes." Either "birthday wishes" or "a birthday wish" would be acceptable.

But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "thoughts" should be pluralized.
2. The singular noun "personality" means a collection of traits, behaviors, or emotional qualities that make up an individual's character. The plural noun "personalities" refers to the personalities of multiple people.

Error_sentence: Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed .
Correct_sentence: Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make the right decision after they have be informed .
Prediction: 
1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "Parents know what the best is for their children" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "parents know what a best is for their children", which implies that the outcome is one of several.

Errors:
1. Error: with, Correction:
2. Error: have, Correction: has
Explanations:
1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".
cleaned: 1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "Parents know what the best is for their children" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "parents know what a best is for their children", which implies that the outcome is one of several.
Label: 1. The sentence is mentioning one specific decision, i.e., the correct one, so use the definite article, "the".

1. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."
Erroneous sentence: In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Correct sentence: In past decades , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even a letter .

cleaned: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the contacts of a specific person, for example, "the face-to-face human contact of an individual."
2. The singular noun "contact" refers to a single instance of communication between two people. For example, "I had a contact with an old friend" or "She had a contact with the doctor" are two contacts. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "contacts" should be pluralized.
Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.




Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Prediction: 
1. The word "research" is a singular noun, so the plural "researches" is incorrect.
2. The word "show" is a verb, so the verb "shows" is correct.
Erroneous sentence: For example , in the case of a person who is addicted to social media sites , he or she would not be able to talk to his or her loved ones face-to-face .
Correct sentence: For example , in the case of a person who is addicted to social media sites , he or she would not be able to talk to his or her loved ones face-to-face .
Errors:
1. Error: he or she, Correction: he/she
2. Error: face-to-face, Correction: face-to-face
Explanations:
1. The word "he or she" is a singular pronoun, so the singular "he/she" is correct.
2. The word "face-to-face" is an adjective, so the adjective "face-to-face" is correct.
Erroneous sentence: This is because of the fact that the person who is addicted to social media sites would not be able to talk to his or her loved ones face-to-face .
Correct sentence: This is because of the fact that the person who is addicted to social media sites would not be able to talk to his or her loved ones face-to-face .
Errors:
1. Error: fact, Correction:  
2. Error: face-to-face, Correction: face-to-face
Explanations:
1. The word "fact" is a singular noun, so the singular "fact" is correct.
2. The word "face-to-face" is an adjective, so the adjective "face-to-face" is correct.
cleaned: 1. The word "research" is a singular noun, so the plural "researches" is incorrect.
2. The word "show" is a verb, so the verb "shows" is correct.
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.

Correct_sentence: Writing is an essential skill for person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Prediction: 
1. The preposition "of" is used to refer to a possession, such as "the house of my friend." The preposition "for" is used to refer to a purpose, such as "I went to the store for milk." In this sentence, the preposition "for" should be used because the purpose of writing is to express one's own feelings and opinions.

1. Error: in, Correction: on
2. Error: the, Correction:  
3. Error: image, Correction: images
4. Error: in, Correction: on
5. Error: do, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the
cleaned: 1. The preposition "of" is used to refer to a possession, such as "the house of my friend." The preposition "for" is used to refer to a purpose, such as "I went to the store for milk." In this sentence, the preposition "for" should be used because the purpose of writing is to express one's own feelings and opinions.
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the skill of writing) with regard to whom (a person).

Label: 1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."

Correct_sentence: And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life . Products such as RFID tracking systems have become real .
Prediction:

"Becomes" is the present tense of "become" and is used to describe a change that is happening now or will happen in the future.

2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".

Correct sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenge for the innovators .

Error_sentence: People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
Correct_sentence: People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
Prediction: 
1. "Length" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

cleaned: 1. "Length" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "as" to make "as short as."
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".

Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.

Explanations:
1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.

2. When referencing relationships as a general concept, the plural "relationships" should be used because it references multiple relationships between many different people. The singular "relationship" is used to refer to individual relationships, with "a relationship" meaning any relationship and "the relationship" meaning one relationship specifically.

2. The concept of "China" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific China instead of the general concept.

Error_sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease .
Correct_sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance of carrying certain disease .
Prediction: 
1. The preposition "of" should be used instead of "to" because "chance" is an uncountable noun.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "carrying" to go with "chance."
Erroneous sentence: This is due to the fact that they are not aware of the existence of the genetic risk .
Correct sentence: This is due to the fact that they are not aware of the existence of the genetic risk .
Errors:
1. Error: fact, Correction: facts
Explanations:
1. This is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. It should be the plural "facts" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential ethical issues. 
Erroneous sentence: With the aid of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily .
Correct sentence: With the aid of social media , people bond globally , information flows rapidly , and humans live happily .
Errors:
1. Error: bonds, Correction: bond
2. Error: human, Correction: humans
3. Error: lives, Correction: live
4. Error: aids, Correction: aid
Explanations:
1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "bond" to go with "people".
2. This sentence is talking about humans in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "live" to go with "humans".
4. "Aid" used in the sense of help or assistance is an uncountable noun and therefore should not be pluralised.
cleaned: 1. The preposition "of" should be used instead of "to" because "chance" is an uncountable noun.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "carrying" to go with "chance."
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.

Erroneous sentence: In addition , the carrier might not be able to have a child of her own .
Correct sentence: In addition , the carrier might not be able to have a child of her own .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction: a
Explanations:
1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the carrier" implies that there is only one carrier. The phrase "a carrier," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier might not be able to have a child of her own due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a carrier."
cleaned: 1. The word "emotional" is an adjective, while the word "emotional" is a noun. In this case, the word "emotional" is used as a noun, so it should be spelled as "emotional."
Label: 1. This is a typo. The correct spelling is "emotional."

Erroneous sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .
Correct sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation , particularly small children who are studying in nursery .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: ,
2. Error: in particularly for, Correction: particularly
3. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.
2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own.
3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.
Erroneous sentence: Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .
Correct sentence: Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or afraid of .
Errors:
1. Error: be, Correction:  
Explanations:

cleaned: 1. The article "a" should be used before "more convenient contact environment" because it refers to a group of people.
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is used when something exists in an unspecified manner or amount, or to express one out of multiple options. The phrase "convenient contact environment" means one potential environment out of many, with varying degrees of convenience. This condition is best expressed by the indefinite article "a."

2. Unnecessary word. If you were using "of" it would be okay to write "of the benefits and down sides", but "the" is not necessary when using "of".
Label: 1. The verb "discuss" does not take the preposition "about." While "about" is used with similar verbs like "tell" or "talk," in the case of "discuss," the object simply comes directly after, with no need for a preposition.
2. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.

Prediction: 
1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
2. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the skill of writing) with regard to whom (a person).

Error_sentence: Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Correct_sentence: Some genes will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Prediction: 
1. "Genetic" is an adjective that modifies the noun "gene", so it should not be capitalized.
2. The singular "gene" is used to refer to a single gene, while the plural "genes" is used to refer to multiple genes.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Correct sentence: In addition , it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: the, Correction:  
3. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
2. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.
3. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
cleaned: 1. "Genetic" is an adjective that modifies the noun "gene", so it should not be capitalized.
2. The singular "gene" is used to refer to a single gene, while the plural "genes" is used to refer to multiple genes.
Label: 1. The adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted.
2. The word "some" means an unspecified amount or a large amount. It is usually used with plural nouns. Also, it is unlikely that there is only one gene that can only be inherited by a specific gender, so logically it is more likely to be the plural.

Correct_sentence: Many people say they will support social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
Prediction: 
1. The subject of the statement is "many people," which is plural, so the verb that describes it should be plural as well.
2. The article "the" should be removed because it is not needed.
Erroneous sentence: For example , the auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Correct sentence: For example , the auto correction software is so effective when using electronic devices until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Errors:
1. Error: device, Correction: devices
2. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. "Auto-correct" is a feature that is common to many different electronic devices, so the plural "devices" should be used. The singular "device" is used to refer to individual devices, with "a device" meaning any device and "the device" meaning one specific device.
2. The article "the" should be removed because it is not needed.
Erroneous sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Correct sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Errors:
1. Error: polices, Correction: police
2. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:

2. The article "the" should be removed because it is not needed.
Erroneous sentence: That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
Correct sentence: That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
Errors:

2. The article "the" should be removed because it is not needed.
Erroneous sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct sentence: One of the disadvantages
cleaned: 1. The subject of the statement is "many people," which is plural, so the verb that describes it should be plural as well.
2. The article "the" should be removed because it is not needed.
Label: 1. The subject here is the plural "people," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "say."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.




Error_sentence: As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
Correct_sentence: As time passes , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "As time passes" refers to an ongoing process, so it should be the present tense "passes" instead of the past tense "passed."
Erroneous sentence: I am not sure if they are friends .
Correct sentence: I am not sure if they are friends .
Errors:
1. Error: are, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The verb "are" is in the present tense, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
Erroneous sentence: In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Correct sentence: In past decades , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Errors:
1. Error: connect, Correction: connected
2. Error: live, Correction: lived
Explanations:
1. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."
cleaned: 1. The phrase "As time passes" refers to an ongoing process, so it should be the present tense "passes" instead of the past tense "passed."
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.

Correct_sentence: In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
Prediction: 
1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "interpersonal skill" should be pluralised.
2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "interpersonal skill" should be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about others .
Correct sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has knowledge about others .
Errors:
1. Error: a, Correction:  
2. Error: concurently, Correction: concurrently
Explanations:
1. "Knowledge" is an uncountable and abstract noun, so it cannot be made singular or plural, thus it cannot be used with the indefinite article 'a.'
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "concurrently".
cleaned: 1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "interpersonal skill" should be pluralised.
2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "interpersonal skill" should be pluralised.
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Interpersonal skills" is the third person plural, so use "are" to correspond with it.

Correct_sentence: There are many people on social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages , however in real life , he or she may not have jobs or live poorly .
Prediction: 
1. "Social media" is a collective noun, so it should be followed by the preposition "on" rather than "in".
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.
3. The singular noun "image" refers to a single picture. For example, "I took a picture of my new car" or "She took a picture of the sunset" are two images. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "images" should be pluralized.
4. "Social media" is a collective noun, so it should be followed by the preposition "on" rather than "in".
5. The subject here is the plural "people," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "have".
Erroneous sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .
Correct sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times .

1. When generally referring to a period of hardship, time is pluralised, so the correct expression is "the hard times".
Erroneous sentence: It means that one can not know another 's real thought and personalities by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
Correct sentence: It means that one can not know another 's real thoughts and personality by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
Errors:
1. Error: thought, Correction: thoughts
2. Error: personalities, Correction: personality
Explanations:
1. The singular noun "thought" refers to a single idea or opinion. For example, "I think I'd like eggs for breakfast" or "She thinks it would be fun to try beekeeping" are two thoughts. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "thoughts" should be pluralized.
2. The singular noun "personality"
cleaned: 1. "Social media" is a collective noun, so it should be followed by the preposition "on" rather than "in".
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.
3. The singular noun "image" refers to a single picture. For example, "I took a picture of my new car" or "She took a picture of the sunset" are two images. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "images" should be pluralized.
4. "Social media" is a collective noun, so it should be followed by the preposition "on" rather than "in".
5. The subject here is the plural "people," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "have".
Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.

Erroneous sentence: As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
Correct sentence: As time passes , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .

The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.
cleaned: 1. This sentence is talking about social media sites in general and therefore should not have an article.

Error_sentence: Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
Correct_sentence: Personally I am studying oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friends .
Prediction: 
1. The present progressive tense should be used to show that the action of studying is currently still happening. To create the present progressive, we use "am" and the present participle "studying."
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.
3. The plural "friends" is used when referring to more than one friend. This sentence is referring to more than one friend, so the plural "friends" should be used instead of the singular "friend."
Erroneous sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement .
Correct sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to high-velocity technological advancement .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:

Erroneous sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem .
Correct sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately becomes really a big problem .
Errors:
1. Error: become, Correction: becomes
Explanations:
1. Incorrect conjugation. "Expressing themselves" is the third person singular, so use "becomes" to correspond with it.
cleaned: 1. The present progressive tense should be used to show that the action of studying is currently still happening. To create the present progressive, we use "am" and the present participle "studying."
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.
3. The plural "friends" is used when referring to more than one friend. This sentence is referring to more than one friend, so the plural "friends" should be used instead of the singular "friend."
Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.

1. The subject here is the plural "teenagers," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "claim."
cleaned: 1. The subject here is the plural "teenagers," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "claim."
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today."

2. The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.
3. We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".

Error_sentence: Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .
Correct_sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to .
Prediction: 
1. "Engineering" is a proper noun, so it should be capitalised.
2. The phrase "fused by" should be reworded to "by fellow engineers."
3. The phrase "in the aid of" should be reworded to "in the aid of."
4. The phrase "desired deeds" should be reworded to "desired deeds."
Erroneous sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Correct sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Errors:
1. Error: qualified, Correction:  
2. Error: resource, Correction: resources
Explanations:
1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle. 
Erroneous sentence: Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .

Explanations:
1. "Engineering" is a proper noun, so it should be capitalised.
2. The phrase "fused by" should be reworded to "by fellow engineers."

cleaned: 1. "Engineering" is a proper noun, so it should be capitalised.
2. The phrase "fused by" should be reworded to "by fellow engineers."
3. The phrase "in the aid of" should be reworded to "in the aid of."
4. The phrase "desired deeds" should be reworded to "desired deeds."
Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."

Correct_sentence: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Prediction: 
1. The preposition "to" is used to indicate the direction or destination of an action, while the preposition "of" is used to indicate the origin or source of something. In this case, "global warming" is the source of the "further catastrophes", so "of" should be used instead of "to".
2. The verb "give" is used to indicate the transfer of something from one person or thing to another. In this case, "global warming" is the cause of the "further catastrophes", so the verb "cause" should be used instead of "give".

Correct sentence: It is a fact that the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is increasing every year .
Errors:
1. Error: green house gases, Correction: greenhouse gases
Explanations:
1. The phrase "greenhouse gases" refers to gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The phrase "green house gases" is not a recognized term and should be corrected to "greenhouse gases".

Correct_sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "an unhealthy baby" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "babies," so it should be the singular "baby."

3. Error: at, Correction: in
Explanations:
1. This sentence is talking about privacy issues in general, so "issue" should be pluralised.

Correct sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one year ago,when I just arrived singapore .

Explanations:
1. The phrase "one year" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "years," so it should be the singular "year."
cleaned: 1. The phrase "an unhealthy baby" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "babies," so it should be the singular "baby."
2. The phrase "the end of their marriage" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "marriages," so it should be the singular "marriage."
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".

Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The sentence is talking about people in general, so it does not need an article.
Erroneous sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Errors:
1. Error: Researches, Correction: Research
2. Error: show, Correction: shows
Explanations:
1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.
cleaned: 1. Commas are used to separate items in a list.
Label: 1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.

Erroneous sentence: Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Correct sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Errors:
1. Error: claimed, Correction: claim
Explanations:
1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.

Prediction: 
1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown studies, not a singular known study. 
3. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown users, not a singular known user.

Errors:
1. Error: spend, Correction: spending

Explanations:
1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.

Correct_sentence: A family of four having dinner in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .
Prediction: 
1. The word "dinner" is a noun that refers to a meal eaten at the end of the day. The word "dinners" is a plural noun that refers to multiple meals eaten at the end of the day. This sentence is referring to a single meal, so the singular noun "dinner" should be used.

Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner. A meal is still referred to in the singular when it is shared by multiple people. Therefore, it should be "having dinner" rather than "having dinners."

Correct sentence: It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally .
Errors:
1. Error: connect, Correction: connects

Correct_sentence: It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skills will be badly affected .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "on the internet" is unnecessary. "Chatting on the internet" is redundant because "chatting" already implies that it is on the internet.

2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct_sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Prediction: 
1. The word "rely" means to depend on someone or something for help or support. In this sentence, the children depend on their parents for help or support, so the preposition "on" should be used instead of the comma.

2. This sentence is talking about parents in general, so "parent" should be pluralised.
Label: 1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
2. The subject is "children," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.

Correct_sentence: This could lead to psychological implications and thus cause many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
Prediction: 
1. "Causing" is the present participle form of the verb "cause," while "cause" is the infinitive form of the verb "cause." The infinitive form is used when the verb is the subject of the sentence, while the present participle form is used when the verb is the object of the sentence. In this case, the verb "cause" is the subject of the sentence, so the infinitive form "cause" should be used.

cleaned: 1. The word "a" is used before a singular noun, while "the" is used before a plural noun. In your sentence, "burden" is a singular noun, so you should use "a" before it.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."




Error_sentence: I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .
Correct_sentence: I noticed a real story in newspaper years ago .
Prediction: 
1. "Newspaper" is a countable noun, so you need to use the preposition "in" instead of "on".
Erroneous sentence: I would like to do a research on social media sites .
Correct sentence: I would like to do a research about social media sites .
Errors:
1. Error: on, Correction: about
Explanations:
1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so you need to use the preposition "about" instead of "on".
Erroneous sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .
Correct sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers from making more effort to do research and design , and they have little motivation to work hard .
Errors:
1. Error: to make, Correction: from making
2. Error: for, Correction: and
3. Error: will, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
cleaned: 1. "Newspaper" is a countable noun, so you need to use the preposition "in" instead of "on".
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".

Correct sentence: There are a lot of factors to be considered when designing a product .
Errors:

Erroneous sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Correct sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Errors:
1. Error: , Correction: the
Explanations:
1. Missing article. As you are talking specifically about the next generation, use the definite article, "the".
cleaned: 1. The conditional clause "if" is not needed here, as the sentence is not expressing a conditional statement.
Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.

Error_sentence: When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
Correct_sentence: When people around us know that we got a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , whether caring for us too much or keeping away from us .
Prediction: 
1. The indefinite article "a" is used to refer to a specific disease, while the definite article "the" is used to refer to a general disease.
2. While the phrase "altitudes will be easily changed" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "attitudes will be easily changed," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.

It's typical to say "attitudes will be easily changed," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."

Prediction: 
1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.

cleaned: 1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.
2. Use the definite article "the" before "next year's NCEE".
3. "Top 1 student" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "top student" on its own.
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.

3. This sentence is talking about material in general, so "the" should be removed.
4. This sentence is talking about natural disasters in general, so "the" should be removed.
5. This sentence is talking about natural disasters in general, so "disaster" should be pluralised.
Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.

1. Error: but, Correction: and
Explanations:
1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.
