Error_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Prediction: 
1. The adjective "qualified" is redundant because it is already implied in the phrase "creative human resources". The phrase "creative human resources" means people who have the ability to come up with creative ideas, and "qualified" means that they have the qualifications to do so. Therefore, it is redundant to say "creative qualified human resources".
2. "Resource" is an uncountable noun, so it should be pluralised to "resources" when referring to more than one resource.
3. "Human resource" is an uncountable noun, so it should be pluralised to "human resources" when referring to more than one resource.
Erroneous sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Correct sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Explanations:

3. "Human resource" is an uncountable noun, so it should be pluralised to "human resources" when referring to more than one resource.
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

Correct_sentence: On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "on the other hand" is an idiom that means "however" or "on the contrary." It is used to introduce a contrasting idea. The phrase "on the other side" is not idiomatic.
2. The subject of the sentence is "a person," which is singular, so the verb should be the third person singular "wants."

2. The subject of the sentence is "a person," which is singular, so the verb should be the third person singular "wants."
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Error_sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct_sentence: One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .
Prediction: 
1. This sentence is talking about disadvantages in general, so "disadvantage" should be pluralised to "disadvantages".
2. The definite article "the" is used to refer to a specific instance of something, but this sentence is talking about disadvantages in general, so the definite article should be removed.
3. The phrase "lose interest in" means to no longer be interested in something. The phrase "lose the interest of" means to no longer have the attention of someone, so it should be changed to "lose interest in".
The phrase "lose the interest of" means to no longer have the attention of someone, so it should be changed to "lose interest in".
The phrase "lose interest in" means to no longer be interested in something. The phrase "lose the interest of" means to no longer have the attention of someone, so it should be changed to "lose interest in".

2. The definite article "the" is used to refer to a specific instance of something, but this sentence is talking about disadvantages in general, so the definite article should be removed.
3. The phrase "lose interest in" means to no longer be interested in something. The phrase "lose the interest of" means to no longer have the attention of someone, so it should be changed to "lose interest in".
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.

Correct_sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .

Correct_sentence: It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally .
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect conjugation. The subject of the sentence is "internet," which is third person singular, so the verb should be "connects." "Connect" is the base form of the verb, which is used in the infinitive (to connect) and the present participle (connecting). The third person singular form is "connects," and the past tense is "connected." The past participle is "connected." The gerund is "connecting." The noun form is "connection." The adjective form is "connective." The adverb form is "connectively." The uncountable noun form is "connectivity." The countable noun form is "connections." The noun form "connection" can also be used as a verb meaning "to establish a connection." The uncountable noun form "connectivity" can also be used as an adjective meaning "having connections."

"Connect" is the base form of the verb, which is used in the infinitive (to connect) and the present participle (connecting).

Correct_sentence: When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use social media to get in contact with our friends .
Prediction: 
1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take an article.
2. The phrase "get in contact with" is more commonly used than "get contact with."

Error_sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .
Correct_sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .
Prediction: 
1. The word "however" is used to introduce a contrasting idea. The phrase "the more people using it over us, the more power they will have on us" is not a contrasting idea, so "however" should be removed.
2. "Using" is a gerund, which is a noun form of a verb. The phrase "the more people use it on us, the more power they will have over us" is a comparison, so the gerund "use" should be used instead of the verb "using."
3. The preposition "on" is used to indicate that something is being done to someone or something. The phrase "the more people use it on us, the more power they will have over us" is a comparison, so the preposition "on" should be used instead of "over."
4. The preposition "over" is used to indicate that something is being done to someone or something. The phrase "the more people use it on us, the more power they will have over us" is a comparison, so the preposition "over" should be used instead of "on."

Correct_sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "the right" is an uncountable noun, so it should take the definite article "the" instead of the possessive adjective "their."

Error_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .
Correct_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers from making more effort to do research and design , and they have little motivation to work hard .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "to make more effort to do research and design" is a noun phrase, so it should use the gerund "making" instead of the infinitive "to make".
2. The phrase "for they will have little motivation to work hard" is a dependent clause, so it should use the conjunction "and" instead of the preposition "for".
3. The phrase "for they will have little motivation to work hard" is a dependent clause, so it should use the conjunction "and" instead of the preposition "for".
The phrase "for they will have little motivation to work hard" is a dependent clause, so it should use the conjunction "and" instead of the preposition "for".

3. The phrase "for they will have little motivation to work hard" is a dependent clause, so it should use the conjunction "and" instead of the preposition "for".
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."

cleaned: 1. This sentence is talking about something that has already happened, so the past tense "transferred" should be used. "Transfer" is the present tense, which is used to talk about something that is happening now or will happen in the future. Incorrect: Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies for spying and advertising .
Label: 1. This is the passive voice, continuing from the phrase "is recorded." The passive voice requires a form of the verb "to be" followed by a secondary verb, which is always the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "transfer" to the past participle "transferred."

I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.

Correct_sentence: Since this happens more often in countries which are much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child without knowing where the child has been brought to .
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect conjugation. The subject of the sentence is "this," which is singular, so the verb should be "happens."
2. Unnecessary article. The sentence is talking about countries in general, so the definite article "the" is not needed.
3. Unnecessary article. The sentence is talking about countries in general, so the definite article "the" is not needed.
4. Incorrect conjugation. The subject of the sentence is "countries," which is plural, so the verb should be "are."
5. Unnecessary word. The phrase "find back" is redundant, as "find" already means to locate something that has been lost.

5. Unnecessary word. The phrase "find back" is redundant, as "find" already means to locate something that has been lost.
Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.




Error_sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenges for the innovators .
Correct_sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenge for the innovators .
Prediction: 
1. The noun "challenge" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralized. It takes the definite article "the" when referring to a specific challenge, and the indefinite article "a" or "an" when referring to a general challenge. It can also be used without an article when referring to challenges in general. The plural "challenges" is only used when referring to multiple specific challenges. Therefore, the plural "challenges" should be changed to the singular "challenge."

Prediction: 
1. The subject "both of his parents" is plural, so the verb "have" should be used.
2. The phrase "under high risk" is incorrect. The correct phrase is "at high risk."
3. The phrase "under high risk" is incorrect. The correct phrase is "at high risk."

Correct_sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Prediction: 
1. This sentence is talking about a specific next generation, so "the" should be used. "The" is used to refer to something specific, while "a/an" is used to refer to something general or unspecified. "The next generation" refers to the next generation of a specific family, so "the" should be used. "A next generation" would refer to any next generation of any family, but that is not what the sentence is talking about, so "a next generation" is incorrect.

Error_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
Correct_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
Prediction: 
1. "Shall" is used to express the future tense, as in "I shall go to the store." It is not used to express an opinion, so "should" should be used instead.
2. "For" means "because of" or "in exchange for," so it should be changed to "to" to mean "available to."
3. "And" means "in addition to" or "combined with," so it should be changed to "or" to mean "instead of."

3. "And" means "in addition to" or "combined with," so it should be changed to "or" to mean "instead of."
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.

Correct_sentence: In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees to spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Prediction: 
1. The definite article "the" is used to refer to a specific thing. "The corporate world" refers to the world of business, so it should be preceded by the definite article.
2. "Network" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralized.
3. "Spend" is a transitive verb, so it needs an object. The object of "spend" is "their office time," so "spend" should be changed to the gerund "spending."

cleaned: 1. The definite article "the" is used to refer to a specific thing. "The corporate world" refers to the world of business, so it should be preceded by the definite article.
2. "Network" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralized.
3. "Spend" is a transitive verb, so it needs an object. The object of "spend" is "their office time," so "spend" should be changed to the gerund "spending."
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."

2. The preposition "on" is used with "spend time on" and "use time on." The preposition "in" is used with "spend time in" and "use time in." In this sentence, the phrase "spend time on" is used, so the preposition "in" should be changed to "on."
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Error_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Correct_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "despite of" is incorrect. It should be "despite the distance." "Despite" is a preposition, so it needs to be followed by a noun or noun phrase. "The distance" is a noun phrase, so it can be used with "despite." "Of" is not a preposition, so it cannot be used with "despite." The phrase "despite of" is not used in English. The phrase "despite the distance" means that the distance is a factor that is not taken into consideration. In other words, the distance does not affect the relationship. "Despite" means "in spite of," so "despite the distance" means "in spite of the distance." "In spite of the distance" means that the distance does not affect the relationship.  
The phrase "despite of" is not used in English. The phrase "despite the distance" means that the distance is a factor that is not taken into consideration.

The indefinite article "a" is used before words that start with a consonant sound, and the indefinite article "an" is used before words that start with a vowel sound. The word "policy" starts with a consonant sound, so the indefinite article "a" should be used. The indefinite article "an" is used before words that start with a vowel sound, and the indefinite article "a" is used before words that start with a consonant sound.

Correct_sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately becomes really a big problem .
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect conjugation. The subject of the sentence is "expressing," which is singular, so the verb should be conjugated as "becomes."

Therefore, "themselves" should be changed to "one's self" or "oneself," which is the reflexive pronoun for the indefinite pronoun "one." The indefinite pronoun "one" refers to people in general, so "one's self" or "oneself" means "one's own self" or "one's own selves," which is the same as "themselves."

2. "Aspect" refers to a part of something, but "role" refers to the function of something. In this sentence, the writer is talking about the function of face-to-face human interaction, so "aspect" should be changed to "role".
Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".

Error_sentence: Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue .
Correct_sentence: Here I want to share Forest 's view on this issue .
Prediction: 
1. The possessive pronoun " 's " is used to show that something belongs to someone or something. In this sentence, the view belongs to Forest, so it should be "Forest 's view". " 's " is a contraction of "is" or "has", so it is always followed by a noun. "Forest'view" is not a noun, so it should be "Forest 's view". "Forest'view" is also missing an apostrophe. The apostrophe in " 's " is a contraction of the letter "i" in "is" or "has", so it should be "Forest 's view". The apostrophe in "Forest's" is a contraction of the letter "o" in "of", so it should be "Forest 's view". The apostrophe in "Forest's" is a contraction of the letter "o" in "of", so it should be "Forest 's view".

cleaned: 1. The noun "length" is uncountable, so the plural form "lengths" should be used.
2. The adjective "short" is uncountable, so the comparative form "shorter" should be used.
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".

cleaned: 1. The phrase "a discovery under an accidental case" does not make sense. The phrase "under an accidental case" should be replaced with "the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery."
2. Missing conjunction. Add "in."
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.

Correct_sentence: However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "the existence of social media sites" is a noun phrase, so it should be preceded by the definite article "the".

2. The subject of the sentence is "the existence of social media sites", which is a singular noun phrase, so the verb should be the third person singular form "has".
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".

Correct_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Prediction: 
1. The preposition "of" is used to refer to something that belongs to or is part of something else, while the preposition "on" is used to refer to something that relies on something else. The sentence is talking about the reliance on social media and the Internet, so "on" is the correct preposition to use.
2. The definite article "the" is used to refer to something specific, but the sentence is talking about social media and the Internet in general, so the definite article should be omitted.

Correct_sentence: Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "there is a need" is an idiomatic expression, so it should be written as one phrase. The indefinite article "a" is used to indicate that there is only one need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media, and that it is a general need that applies to everyone. The definite article "the" is used to refer to a specific need that has already been mentioned or is known to the reader. In this case, the need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media has not been mentioned before, so the indefinite article "a" should be used.

There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.

Correct_sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than five percent of the population in China .
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect word choice. The adjective "lesser" is used to describe something that is of a lower degree or quality than something else, whereas the adjective "less" is used to describe something that is a smaller amount than something else. Here, the sentence is talking about a smaller amount, so "less" is the correct word to use.
2. Unnecessary article. The definite article "the" is used to refer to a specific noun, but the noun "China" is a proper noun, so it does not need an article. Proper nouns refer to specific people, places, or things, so the definite article "the" is not used with proper nouns.

2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.

1. The preposition "in" is used to refer to physical locations, but social media is not a physical location, so the preposition "on" should be used instead.
2. The definite article "the" is used to refer to specific things, but "social media" is a general concept, so the indefinite article "a" should be used instead.
3. The singular noun "image" should be changed to the plural noun "images" to agree with the plural noun "people."
4. The preposition "in" is used to refer to physical locations, but social media is not a physical location, so the preposition "on" should be used instead.
5. The auxiliary verb "do" is used to emphasize the main verb, but the main verb "have" is not emphasized, so the auxiliary verb "do" should be removed.

Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.

This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.

Prediction: 
1. The concept of "society" is a general concept, so it does not need an article.

1. This sentence is talking about an ongoing action, so the present participle "studying" should be used. "Study" is the infinitive form of the verb, which is used to talk about an action in general.
2. The preposition "in" is not needed in this sentence.

Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.

Correct_sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "engineering design process" is a noun phrase, so it should be preceded by the definite article "the".
2. The phrase "by fellow engineers" is a prepositional phrase, so it should be preceded by the preposition "by".
3. The phrase "the current" is a noun phrase, so it should be preceded by the definite article "the".

12. The phrase "desired deeds" is a noun phrase, so it should be preceded by the definite article "the".
13. The phrase "desired deeds" is a noun phrase, so it should be preceded by the definite article "the".
Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."




Error_sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
Correct_sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger ?
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect word choice. The verb "put" is used to mean "cause (someone or something) to be in (a particular place or state)." The verb "get" is used to mean "become" or "obtain." In this context, "get" means "become," which does not make sense in this sentence. The correct word is "put."
Incorrect sentences:
1. How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?

Correct sentences:
1. How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
2. How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger ?
cleaned: 1. Incorrect word choice. The verb "put" is used to mean "cause (someone or something) to be in (a particular place or state)." The verb "get" is used to mean "become" or "obtain." In this context, "get" means "become," which does not make sense in this sentence. The correct word is "put."
Label: 1. The phrase "put in danger" is a common expression and the verb does not change. The verb "put" means to cause someone to be in a particular place or position.

cleaned: 1. "Cause" is always followed by "of," and "give rise" is always followed by "to."
2. "Cause" is an uncountable noun, so it takes the singular verb "gives."
Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.




Error_sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
Correct_sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
Prediction: 
1. Unnecessary word. "Confidential" is an adjective, so it does not need the preposition "in" to connect it to the noun phrase "the genetic risk of getting the disease." It can be used on its own to modify the noun phrase "the genetic risk of getting the disease."

2. Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
cleaned: 1. Unnecessary word. "Confidential" is an adjective, so it does not need the preposition "in" to connect it to the noun phrase "the genetic risk of getting the disease." It can be used on its own to modify the noun phrase "the genetic risk of getting the disease."
Label: 1. The statement is confusing two phrases: "keep confidential" and "in confidence." The phrase "keep confidential" is common and is used without variation in wording.




Error_sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have a unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage .
Correct_sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
Prediction: 
1. The word "unhealthy" starts with a vowel sound, so it takes the indefinite article "an" instead of "a."
2. The phrase "the end of their marriage" refers to a specific marriage, so it takes the definite article "the." The phrase "the death of the baby" also refers to a specific baby, so it takes the definite article "the" as well. The phrase "a unhealthy baby" refers to any unhealthy baby, so it takes the indefinite article "a."
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction, followed by the explicit errors in this sentence. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.

Errors:
1. Error: a, Correction: an
2. Error:  , Correction: the
Explanations:
1. The word "unhealthy" starts with a vowel sound, so it takes the indefinite article "an" instead of "a."
2. The phrase "the end of their marriage" refers to a specific marriage, so it takes the definite article "the." The phrase "the death of the baby" also refers to a specific baby, so it takes the definite article "the" as well. The phrase "a unhealthy baby" refers to any unhealthy baby, so it takes the indefinite article "a."
cleaned: 1. The word "unhealthy" starts with a vowel sound, so it takes the indefinite article "an" instead of "a."
2. The phrase "the end of their marriage" refers to a specific marriage, so it takes the definite article "the." The phrase "the death of the baby" also refers to a specific baby, so it takes the definite article "the" as well. The phrase "a unhealthy baby" refers to any unhealthy baby, so it takes the indefinite article "a."
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".

Error_sentence: Personally I feel more at ease on social medias .
Correct_sentence: Personally I feel more at ease on social media .
Prediction: 
1. "Media" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralized. "Social media" refers to the concept of social media as a whole, so the singular "media" should be used. The plural "medias" could refer to different types of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, but that is not the meaning of the sentence, which is referring to the concept of social media as a whole. Therefore, the singular "media" should be used. Additionally, the plural "medias" is grammatically incorrect. The plural of "media" is "media," not "medias." The plural of "medium" is "media," and the plural of "mediums" is "mediums," but the plural of "media" is "media." Therefore, the singular "media" should be used.

Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.

In this sentence, the phrase "just communicate with friends on facebook" is an addition to the phrase "neglect people surrounding him or her," so "and" should be used instead of "but." The use of "but" implies that communicating with friends on Facebook is the opposite of neglecting the people around you, which is not the case. It is possible to neglect the people around you and communicate with friends on Facebook at the same time, so "and" should be used instead of "but." Also, "and" is used to connect two clauses, while "but" is used to connect two phrases.

Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner.

Error_sentence: I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .
Correct_sentence: I noticed a real story in newspaper years ago .
Prediction: 
1. The preposition "on" is used to refer to the surface of something, while "in" is used to refer to the interior of something. "Newspaper" refers to the paper itself, so "in" is the correct preposition to use. "In" can also be used to refer to the contents of something, so it can be used with "newspaper" to refer to the articles inside it. "On" is used to refer to the surface of something, so it can be used with "newspaper" to refer to the surface of the paper, as in "There was an ad on the newspaper." It can also be used with "newspaper" to refer to the front page of the paper, as in "There was an article on the front page of the newspaper." However, it cannot be used with "newspaper" to refer to the contents of the paper, so "in" is the correct preposition to use in this sentence. "In" can also be used to refer to a time period, as in "I lived in the 1980s" or "I worked in the 1990s," so it can be used with "newspaper" to refer to a time period, as in "I read the newspaper in the 1980s." "On" cannot be used to refer to a time period, so it is never used with "newspaper" to refer to a time period. Therefore, "in" is the correct preposition to use in this sentence.

Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".

Errors
cleaned: 1. Incorrect conjunction. The correct conjunction is "and".
Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.

2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.

1. Incorrect spelling. The plural of "status" is "statuses". "Status" is the noun form of the verb "to status", meaning "to give a status to" or "to make the status of".

Error_sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .
Correct_sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay for another year in the secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top student in his province .
Prediction: 
1. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the purpose of an action. In this sentence, the purpose of staying another year in secondary school is to take the next year's NCEE, so "for" should be used.
2. "Secondary school" is a countable noun, so it should be preceded by the definite article "the" or the indefinite article "a." In this sentence, the definite article "the" should be used because it is referring to a specific secondary school.
3. The phrase "become the top 1 student in his province" should be changed to "become the top student in his province." The number "1" is redundant because "top" already implies that the student is the best in his province. In addition, "student" is a countable noun, so it should be preceded by the definite article "the" or the indefinite article "a." In this sentence, the definite article "the" should be used because it is referring to a specific student.

In this sentence, the definite article "the" should be used because it is referring to a specific student.
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.

3. Uncountable nouns do not take the indefinite article.
4. "Despite" means "in spite of" or "regardless of," but the sentence is talking about how the material supports buildings during natural disasters, so it should be "during."
5. "Disaster" is an uncountable noun, so it should not have an article. "Disasters" is the plural form.
Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.
