Error_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Prediction: 
1. "Qualified" is an adjective, so it should be placed before the noun it modifies, which is "human resource".
2. "Human resource" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "human resource", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".
Erroneous sentence: The rapid development of social media in recent years has changed the way people interact with each other .
Correct sentence: The rapid development of social media in recent years has changed the way people interact with each other .
Explanations:
1. "Social media" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "social media", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".
cleaned: 1. "Qualified" is an adjective, so it should be placed before the noun it modifies, which is "human resource".
2. "Human resource" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "human resource", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle. 




Error_sentence: On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Correct_sentence: On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Prediction: 
1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "on the other hand" to indicate their relationship.
2. Missing word. The correct expression is "wants to confirm".
3. Missing word. The correct expression is "has been prepared to face".
4. Missing word. The correct expression is "can choose to do".
Erroneous sentence: In this case , the person who choose to do the genetic testing individually will have to pay the cost by themselves .
Correct sentence: In this case , the person who chooses to do the genetic testing individually will have to pay the cost by themselves .
Explanations:
1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "in this case" to indicate their relationship.
2. Missing word. The correct expression is "chooses to do".
3. Missing word. The correct expression is "will have to pay".
4. Missing word. The correct expression is "themselves".
5. Missing word. The correct expression is "themselves".
6. Missing word. The correct expression is "themselves".
7. Missing word. The correct expression is "themselves".

2. Missing word. The correct expression is "wants to confirm".
3. Missing word. The correct expression is "has been prepared to face".
4. Missing word. The correct expression is "can choose to do".
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Error_sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct_sentence: One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect conjugation. "Loss" is the third person singular, so use "loses" to correspond with it.
Erroneous sentence: These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Correct sentence: These social media makes people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Explanations:
1. The sentence mentions multiple people, so "life" should be pluralised, as there are multiple lives.
cleaned: 1. Incorrect conjugation. "Loss" is the third person singular, so use "loses" to correspond with it.
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.

However, "should" is a modal verb that is used to indicate a recommendation or suggestion. In this sentence, it is used to indicate that RFID technology should not be made available to the public.

However, "should" is a modal verb that is used to indicate a recommendation or suggestion. In this sentence, it is used to indicate that RFID technology should not be made available to the public. Therefore, "shall" should be replaced with "should" to indicate a recommendation or suggestion.

Error_sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Correct_sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Prediction: 
1. The verb "leaks" is intransitive and does not require a helping verb. The subject "news" is a third person singular, so the verb "leaks" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information."
2. The verb "leaks" is intransitive and does not require a helping verb. The subject "news" is a third person singular, so the verb "leaks" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information."

The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.




Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .

6. The word "people" should be "people that are addicted to social media sites".
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .

3. Incorrect conjugation. Use "was" to go with "thought".
4. Incorrect conjugation. Use "was" to go with "necessary".
5. Incorrect conjugation. Use "was" to go with "Harbin".
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done.

2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.

Error_sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .
Correct_sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .
Prediction: 
1. The conjunction "over" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "on" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "over," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "on" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.
2. The verb "use" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A uses B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
3. The subject is "people," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple people, it involves multiple users, so "users" should be plural too.

Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.

Correct_sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child .

Correct sentence: As time passes , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .

1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.
cleaned: 1. The concept of "rights" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the rights of a specific person, for example, "the rights of an individual."
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".

6. The subject, "this problem," is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "discourages," not "discourages."
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."

Error_sentence: Therefore , I thought a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "known genetic risk" is a noun phrase, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific genetic risk, it is common to say "according to a genetic risk study" or "according to genetic risk research by [author/institution]," but for genetic risk-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to genetic risk."
2. The subject is "I," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "think" for subject-verb agreement.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Correct sentence: In addition , although the unsafe online environment , spending too much time on the internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Explanations:
1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.

Correct_sentence: Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transferred to the companies for spying and advertising .
Prediction: 
1. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."

Correct_sentence: It is weird that people sit around the table but all face their phones and do not talk with to other .
Prediction:

The phrase "table" means one potential table out of many, with varying degrees of weirdness. This condition is best expressed by the indefinite article "a."
Label: 1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.

Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."

Error_sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Correct_sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Prediction: 
1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "As the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a genetic risk may pass down to the next generation," which implies that the outcome is one of several.
Erroneous sentence: These implants and products are also been used as surveillance tools .
Correct sentence: These implants and products have also been used as surveillance tools .
Explanations:
1. The perfect present tense should be used to show that the action of using implants and products is currently still happening. To create the perfect present, we use "have" and the past participle "used." 
Erroneous sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .
Correct sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
Explanations:
1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".
cleaned: 1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many.

If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a genetic risk may pass down to the next generation," which implies that the outcome is one of several.

7. This sentence is referring to the future, as shown by the phrase "I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted." The future tense "be" should be changed to the future tense "be."
8. This sentence is referring to the future, as shown by the phrase "I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted." The future tense "be" should be changed to the future tense "be."
9. This sentence is referring to the future, as shown by the phrase "I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted." The future tense "be" should be changed to the future tense "be."
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.




Error_sentence: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Correct_sentence: In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees to spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Prediction: 
1. "Social media networks" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
3. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
3. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."




Error_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .
Correct_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used on the social media sites .

Correct sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used on the social media sites .
cleaned: 1. The preposition "on" is used to indicate a relationship of location. The preposition "in" is used to indicate a relationship of containment.
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Error_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Correct_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .

Label: 1. Unnecessary word. If you were using "in spite" it would be okay to write "in spite of the distance", but "of" is not necessary when using "despite".

Error_sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Correct_sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal moral morals the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "at risk relatives" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "at risk relatives" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.

Label: 1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."

Error_sentence: On one side , it is obvioualy that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Correct_sentence: On one side , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Prediction: 
1. "Obvioualy" is a misspelling of "obviously."
2. "Obvious" is an adjective, so it should be changed to "obvious."
Erroneous sentence: On the other hand , it is also undeniable that there are some disadvantages .
Correct sentence: On the other hand , it is undeniable that there are some disadvantages .
Explanations:
1. "Undeniably" is a misspelling of "undeniably."
2. "Undeniably" is an adverb, so it should be changed to "undeniably."
cleaned: 1. "Obvioualy" is a misspelling of "obviously."
2. "Obvious" is an adjective, so it should be changed to "obvious."
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "obvious." Also, it looks like the author intended to use the word "obviously," which is an adverb. Adverbs are used to modify verbs, but in this sentence, the word follows "it is" and therefore should be a noun.

Correct_sentence: Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .

2. The verb "are" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "relationships and friendships" is plural, and so the verb "are" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."

Correct sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring some negative effects on our daily lives .

1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
3. This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.
cleaned: 1. Incorrect conjugation. "Neglect" is the third person singular, so use "neglects" to correspond with it.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Communicate" is the third person singular, so use "communicates" to correspond with it.
Label: 1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.

Prediction: 
1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "can come up with" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "can come up with" should be used.

Label: 1. The noun "policy" requires either an article or pluralization. The definite article "the" refers to a specific policy, especially one that was mentioned earlier in the text.

Prediction:

Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "face-to-face human contacts" is not grammatically correct. "Face-to-face" is an adjective, so it should be "face-to-face human contact."
2. The phrase "has decresed" is not grammatically correct. "Decrease" is a verb, so it should be "has decreased."
3. The phrase "the importance of the face-to-face human contacts" is not grammatically correct. "Importance" is a noun, so it should be "the importance of face-to-face human contact."

Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.




Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Prediction: 
1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.
Erroneous sentence: Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is more easier than asking people around in real life .

Error_sentence: Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Correct_sentence: Writing is an essential skill for person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Prediction: 
1. The verb "is" should be changed to "is for" to indicate that writing is an essential skill for someone who expresses their own feelings and opinions.
2. The pronoun "their" should be changed to "their own" to indicate that the feelings and opinions belong to the person who is expressing them.
3. The verb "express" should be changed to "expresses" to indicate that the person who is expressing their feelings and opinions is doing so in the present tense.
4. The pronoun "their" should be changed to "their own" to indicate that the feelings and opinions belong to the person who is expressing them.

Correct_sentence: While we do know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
Prediction: 
1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."
Erroneous sentence: To put it in the nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Correct sentence: To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Explanations:
1. "In a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. The phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but the specificity of "the" makes it sound literal. Instead of referring figuratively to something very simple, it would mean something that is literally inside a nutshell.
Erroneous sentence: Many people says they will support the social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
Correct sentence: Many people say they will support social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
Explanations:
1. The subject here is the plural "people," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "say."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.
cleaned: 1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly.

Correct_sentence: And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life . Products such as RFID tracking systems have become real .
Prediction: 
1. "Result" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. This sentence is talking about products in general and therefore should not have an article.
3. "RFID tracking system" is a proper noun and therefore should not have an article.
Erroneous sentence: In other words , it means that the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Correct sentence: In other words , it means that the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation . Thus it will involve more than just one family .
Explanations:
1. Missing article. As you are talking specifically about the next generation, use the definite article, "the."
2. "Thus it will involve more than just one family" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
3. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.
cleaned: 1. "Result" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. This sentence is talking about products in general and therefore should not have an article.
3. "RFID tracking system" is a proper noun and therefore should not have an article.
Label: 1. Use a full stop to separate these two sentences.
2. The sentence is talking about systems in general, so "system" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem .
Correct_sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately becomes really a big problem .
Prediction:

Erroneous sentence: It is said that , the usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
Correct sentence: It is said that , the usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .

Correct_sentence: More and more networking has been transferred to the internet from real life .
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "networking".
Erroneous sentence: For example , a patient with a genetic risk may not want to have a child .
Correct sentence: For example , a patient with a genetic risk may not want to have a child .
Explanations:
1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "risk".

8. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "a".
9. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "child".
cleaned: 1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "networking".
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Error_sentence: With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life .
Correct_sentence: With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each other through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important role in our life .
Prediction: 
1. The word "face-to-face" is an adjective, so it does not take an article.
2. The word "interaction" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take an article.
3. The word "aspect" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take an article.
4. The word "aspect" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take an article.
cleaned: 1. The word "face-to-face" is an adjective, so it does not take an article.
2. The word "interaction" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take an article.
3. The word "aspect" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take an article.
4. The word "aspect" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take an article.
Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".




Error_sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
Correct_sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows .
Prediction: 
1. "Elaborated" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she elaborated on social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about elaboration as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "elaborated".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Elaborate" is treated as the third person singular, so use "is" to correspond with it.
Erroneous sentence: There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Correct sentence: There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Explanations:
1. Unnecessary word. "Seek out" does not require the preposition "for" to indicate what is being sought out.
Erroneous sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .
Correct sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers from making more effort to do research and design , and they have little motivation to work hard .
Explanations:
1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."
cleaned: 1. "Elaborated" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she elaborated on social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about elaboration as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "elaborated".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Elaborate" is treated as the third person singular, so use "is" to correspond with it.
Label: 1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society, instead of the concept in general.




Error_sentence: Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue .
Correct_sentence: Here I want to share Forest 's view on this issue .
Prediction: 
1. An "s" and a space are missing. There should be an "s" after the apostrophe and "view" should be a separate word.
Erroneous sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .
Correct sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation , particularly small children who are studying in nursery .
Explanations:
1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.
2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own.

Error_sentence: People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
Correct_sentence: People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
Prediction: 
1. The plural "lengths" is correct. The singular "length" is used mostly to refer to a measurement, e.g. "the length of the table."
2. The concept of "great lengths" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the lengths of a specific person, for example, "the great lengths of an individual."
Erroneous sentence: For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Correct sentence: For example , we tend send birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Explanations:
1. The indefinite article "a" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "birthday wishes." Either "birthday wishes" or "a birthday wish" would be acceptable.
Erroneous sentence: For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Correct sentence: For example , we tend send birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Explanations:
1. The indefinite article "a" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "birthday wishes." Either "birthday wishes" or "a birthday wish" would be acceptable.

2. The concept of "great lengths" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the lengths of a specific person, for example, "the great lengths of an individual."
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".




Error_sentence: Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .

Error_sentence: Serendipity is usually defined as a discovery under an accidental case , and it often results the invention of a new technology .
Correct_sentence: Serendipity is usually defined as the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery , and it often results in the invention of a new technology .
Prediction: 
1. "Serendipity" is a proper noun, so it does not need an article.

8. "Serendipity" is a noun, so it does not need a verb.
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.

Label: 1. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and "the computer" meaning one computer specifically.
2. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural.

4. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.
5. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "did" implies that the phone is no longer involved in people's work, so it should be the present tense "do" instead.

Correct_sentence: However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
Prediction: 
1. "The existence of social media sites" is the subject of the sentence, so it should be in the singular form.
2. The phrase "the existence of social media sites" is a noun, so it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "existence".
Erroneous sentence: Social media sites have been known to be the main cause for the decrease of human interaction in the society .
Correct sentence: Social media sites have been known to be the main cause for the decrease of human interaction in society .
Explanations:
1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society, instead of the concept in general.

2. The phrase "the existence of social media sites" is a noun, so it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "existence".
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".

Correct_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Prediction: 
1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .

Error_sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Correct_sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Prediction: 
1. "Time" is a singular noun, so the article "the" should be used before it.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Correct sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .
Explanations:
1. "But" should be used in the situation where you do one thing, but not the other, so you could say, "they don't speak to the people around them, but do communicate with friends on Facebook," but in the context of your sentence, you are saying that both these actions are going on at the same time, so you should use "and", as in they shun/ignore the people around them AND only communicate with friends on Facebook.
Erroneous sentence: The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Correct sentence: The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic devices until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Explanations:

Erroneous sentence: Therefore , considering the people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .

cleaned: 1. "Time" is a singular noun, so the article "the" should be used before it.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.

Correct_sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than five percent of the population in China .
Prediction:

The phrase "five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than five percent of the population in China" is grammatically correct.
Label: 1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.

Correct_sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .

Erroneous sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Correct sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Explanations:
1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.
2. The phrase "with a click away on the refresh button" is redundant. "With a click away" means the same thing as "with a click."
cleaned: 1. The phrase "with a click away on the refresh button" is redundant. "With a click away" means the same thing as "with a click."

Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.

Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is used when something exists in an unspecified manner or amount, or to express one out of multiple options.

Error_sentence: This essay will discuss about both the benefits and down sides of using social media in the contemporary society .
Correct_sentence: This essay will discuss both the benefits and down sides of using social media in contemporary society .
Prediction: 
1. The adjective "contemporary" means "existing or occurring at the same time as something else". In this sentence, "contemporary society" refers to the society that exists at the same time as the essay. Therefore, the phrase "in the contemporary society" is redundant and should be removed.
Erroneous sentence: When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use social media to get contact with our friends .

cleaned: 1. The adjective "contemporary" means "existing or occurring at the same time as something else". In this sentence, "contemporary society" refers to the society that exists at the same time as the essay. Therefore, the phrase "in the contemporary society" is redundant and should be removed.

Correct_sentence: In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
Prediction: 
1. The plural noun "skills" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing skills as a general concept, the plural "skills" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "skill" is used to refer to an individual skill, with "a skill" meaning any skill and "the skill" meaning one skill specifically.

Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image.

This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.

Error_sentence: Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
Correct_sentence: Personally I am studying oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friends .
Prediction: 
1. The verb "study" is always used together with the preposition "in" when describing the place where one studies. The preposition "in" can convey the idea of being in a place, or indicate where an action takes place. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "study."
2. The subject is "I," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "am" for subject-verb agreement.
3. "Friend" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific friend, it is common to say "one of my friends," but for friends in general, the phrase is "my friends."

Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.

Error_sentence: He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet .
Correct_sentence: He can even talk to his daughter face-to-face using video call via the internet .
Prediction: 
1. "Face-to-face" is an idiomatic expression, meaning "in person" or "in the same room as someone else". You can't talk to someone face-to-face via the internet, because you are not in the same room as them.
Erroneous sentence: It is not an easy task to persuade people to change their habits .
Correct sentence: It is not an easy task to persuade people to change their habit .
Explanations:
1. "Habits" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "habit", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".
Erroneous sentence: It is not easy to convince people to change their habits .
Correct sentence: It is not easy to convince people to change their habit .
Explanations:
1. "Habits" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "habit", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".

cleaned: 1. "Face-to-face" is an idiomatic expression, meaning "in person" or "in the same room as someone else". You can't talk to someone face-to-face via the internet, because you are not in the same room as them.
Label: 1. Missing article. "Internet" is the name of a specific network, so use the definite article, "the".
2. The sentence starts with "He", referring to man, but the third person possessive you have used is the female version. Change to "his" to match with "He" and make it clear that you are talking about a man.




Error_sentence: There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Correct_sentence: There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Prediction: 
1. The subject of the sentence is "There is," which is a singular subject, so the verb "are" should be changed to "is."
2. The phrase "seeking out for attention" is a non-restrictive clause, so it should be separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma.
Erroneous sentence: In the past few years , there have been a lot of researches being done in the field of biomedical engineering .
Correct sentence: In the past few years , there have been a lot of researches being done in the field of biomedical engineering .
Explanations:
1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "In the past few years," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "there have been a lot of researches being done in the field of biomedical engineering," a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.
cleaned: 1. The subject of the sentence is "There is," which is a singular subject, so the verb "are" should be changed to "is."
2. The phrase "seeking out for attention" is a non-restrictive clause, so it should be separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma.
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Seek out" does not require the preposition "for" to indicate what is being sought out.




Error_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Correct_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Prediction: 
1. The sentence is mentioning one specific claim, i.e., the correct one, so use the definite article, "the".
Erroneous sentence: For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Correct sentence: For example , we tend send birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Explanations:
1. The indefinite article "a" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "birthday wishes." Either "birthday wishes" or "a birthday wish" would be acceptable.
cleaned: 1. The sentence is mentioning one specific claim, i.e., the correct one, so use the definite article, "the".
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.

2. The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.
3. We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".

Prediction: 
1. Incorrect form. "Additional" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the noun "checks", so you need to use the adverb form, "additionally". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".
2. Incorrect form. "Creates" is a verb, so it needs to go with a verb, but in this sentence it is being used with the noun "costs", so you need to use the adjective form, "creating".

3. Incorrect form. "Creates" is a verb, so it needs to go with a verb, but in this sentence it is being used with the noun "costs", so you need to use the adjective form, "creating".

Error_sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Correct_sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spending too much time on the internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Prediction: 
1. When referencing social networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. The singular "network" is used to refer to an individual network, with "a network" meaning any network and "the network" meaning one network specifically.
2. The phrase "spend too much time" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."

Label: 1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.




Error_sentence: Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .
Correct_sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to .
Prediction: 
1. The concept of "engineering design process" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific engineering design processes, instead of such processes in general.
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people", which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may". It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.

Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."

Correct_sentence: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Prediction: 
1. This is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. It should be the plural "catastrophes" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential catastrophes.
2. This is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. It should be the plural "further catastrophes" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential catastrophes.

3. This is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. It should be the plural "further catastrophes" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential catastrophes.
Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.




Error_sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
Correct_sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
Prediction:

Correct sentence: Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .

Correct_sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
Prediction: 
1. The word "unhealthy" is an adjective, so it should be followed by a noun.
2. The word "unhealthy" is an adjective, so it should be followed by a noun.

3. The word "unhealthy" is an adjective, so it should be followed by a noun.
4. The word "unhealthy" is an adjective, so it should be followed by a noun.
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".




Error_sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .
Correct_sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation , particularly small children who are studying in nursery .
Prediction: 
1. Commas are used to separate clauses in a sentence. In this sentence there are two clauses separated by a comma: "This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation" and "particularly small children who are studying in nursery".
2. The comma is placed incorrectly. It should be placed between the two clauses, not after the first one.
3. The word "particularly" is an adverb, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb "studying", so you need to use the adverb form, "particularly".

Erroneous sentence: This is due to the fact that they do not know how to use the English language properly .
Correct sentence: This is due to the fact that they do not know how to use the English language properly .

Prediction: 
1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.

While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."
cleaned: 1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.

Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .

Error_sentence: Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Correct_sentence: Also , according to research , it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Prediction: 
1. The word "research" is singular, so it should be changed to the singular "research."
2. The word "Facebook" is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.
3. The phrase "unknowingly compare" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "compare" should be changed to "comparing."

Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.




Error_sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Correct_sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .
Prediction: 
1. The verb "neglect" requires the preposition "of" in order to connect to the object, or the person or thing being neglected.
2. The verb "communicate" requires the preposition "with" in order to connect to the object, or the person or thing being communicated with.
Erroneous sentence: There is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Correct sentence: There is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Explanations:
1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need.
cleaned: 1. The verb "neglect" requires the preposition "of" in order to connect to the object, or the person or thing being neglected.
2. The verb "communicate" requires the preposition "with" in order to connect to the object, or the person or thing being communicated with.
Label: 1. "But" should be used in the situation where you do one thing, but not the other, so you could say, "they don't speak to the people around them, but do communicate with friends on Facebook," but in the context of your sentence, you are saying that both these actions are going on at the same time, so you should use "and", as in they shun/ignore the people around them AND only communicate with friends on Facebook.

Correct_sentence: A family of four having dinner in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect conjugation. "Having" is the present participle of the verb "have", so it needs to be in the third person singular to go with "family".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Holding" is the present participle of the verb "hold", so it needs to be in the third person singular to go with "family".

Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner. A meal is still referred to in the singular when it is shared by multiple people. Therefore, it should be "having dinner" rather than "having dinners."




Error_sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma .
Correct_sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas .
Prediction: 
1. The plural form of "dilemma" is "dilemmas," not "dilemma."
Erroneous sentence: In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Correct sentence: In past decades , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Explanations:
1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."
cleaned: 1. The plural form of "dilemma" is "dilemmas," not "dilemma."
Label: 1. This is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. It should be the plural "dilemmas" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential ethical issues.

Prediction: 
1. Unnecessary word. You would use "give" with "birth" if it was going with a noun, as in "She gave birth to a baby", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "birth", you do not need to use "give".

Erroneous sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Explanations:
1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.

Error_sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct_sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Prediction: 
1. The verb "rely" means to depend on someone or something for help, support, or guidance. Its meaning and its connection to the parent are unclear, so it should be deleted.
2. The preposition "on" is used to indicate that the children depend on the parents for help, support, or guidance.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "rely" requires an object, which here is "the parent." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "the parent" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "parents."

Error_sentence: This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
Correct_sentence: This could lead to psychological implications and thus cause many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
Prediction: 
1. The concept of "social effects" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social effects instead of to social effects in general.
2. The word "causing" is a verb, and verbs are used to modify verbs, but in this sentence, the word follows "thus" and therefore should be an adjective. Adjectives are used to modify nouns, so "causing" should be changed to the adjective "causative."
Erroneous sentence: For example , the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than the population in China .
Correct sentence: For example , the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than the population in China .
Explanations:
1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "population," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.

Correct_sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Prediction: 
1. "The manufacture company" should be "the manufacturing company" because "manufacture" is a verb, not a noun.
2. "The company that the innovators are working for" should be "the company that innovators are working for" because "the company that the innovators are working for" is the object of the preposition "for".

Correct_sentence: Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden in her family .
Prediction: 
1. The noun "burden" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state of being a burden, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "burden" instead.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Burden" is the third person singular, so use "is" to correspond with it.
3. Incorrect conjugation. "Burden" is the third person singular, so use "is" to correspond with it.

The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."




Error_sentence: I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .
Correct_sentence: I noticed a real story in newspaper years ago .
Prediction: 
1. The word "real" is an adjective that modifies the noun "story," so it should be placed before the noun.
2. The word "newspaper" is a noun that refers to a specific type of publication, so it should be placed after the preposition "in."

Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".

4. The subject of the statement is "the engineer," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.
Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.

Correct_sentence: These are not the only challenges that innovators are going to deal with .

Erroneous sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Correct sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Explanations:
1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.
Erroneous sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other 's permission , this should not be placed or implanted to anyone .
Correct sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without permission , this technology should not be placed or implanted in anyone .
Explanations:
1. As "permission" is something granted by another person, this is already taken for granted without needing to explicitly say "other's". 
2. You should explicitly state "technology" for clarity.
3. An implant goes inside the body, so you need to use "in" accordingly.
Erroneous sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Correct sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal moral morals the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Explanations:
1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."
Erroneous sentence: A family of four having dinners

Correct_sentence: This is the common law in society .
Prediction: 
1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.

6. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is easily changed (their attitudes) with regard to whom (people around us).
Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

Prediction: 
1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".
Erroneous sentence: As a result , more and more parents are paying attention to their child 's health .
Correct sentence: As a result , more and more parents are paying attention to their child 's health .
Explanations:
1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".
Erroneous sentence: It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connect people globally .
Correct sentence: It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally .
Explanations:
1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.
Erroneous sentence: However , since internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Correct sentence: However , since the internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Explanations:
1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.
cleaned: 1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.

Erroneous sentence: Social media sites such as facebook , twitter , instagram and whatsapp are the most popular social media sites .
Correct sentence: Social media sites such as Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and WhatsApp are the most popular social media sites .

The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.
