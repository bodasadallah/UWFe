1. the word "qualified" is unnecessary in this context. when discussing human resources, it is understood that the resources are qualified, so there is no need to explicitly state it.
2. when referring to human resources as a group of people, it should be treated as a plural noun, hence "resources" is the correct form.

1. "on the other side" is a common error when referring to an alternative perspective or aspect. the correct phrase is "on the other hand."
2. the subject "a person" is singular, so the verb should also be in the singular form, which is "wants" in this case.


1. the phrase "one of" indicates that there are multiple disadvantages, so "disadvantages" should be plural.
2. there should not be an article "the" before "interest" in this context.
3. "loss" should be followed by "in" instead of "of" to correctly show the context of losing interest in face-to-face communication.

1. in modern english, "shall" is rarely used in these contexts. "should" is more appropriate to express an opinion or recommendation, rather than a command or prediction.

1. in this sentence, users' information is being given to companies in exchange for cash, not just in association with it. the preposition "for" is more precise in this context.

1. the word "research" in this context is a mass noun that does not require a plural form. 
2. the verb "show" should agree with the singular noun "research."
1. incorrect preposition. when talking about the reason for something, use "for" instead of "of".
2. missing definite article "the" before "halt" to specify which work is being referred to.
3. missing definite article "the" before "higher level authorities" to indicate specificity.
4. unnecessary preposition "of" after "thought".
1. "polices" should be "police" as it refers to a singular unit of law enforcement, not multiple.
1. subject-verb agreement error. the subject "user" is singular, so the verb "comes" should also be singular to match.
1. incorrect preposition. the verb "rely" requires the preposition "on" to indicate who or what is being depended upon.
2. the singular "parent" indicates one single parent, while the plural form "parents" indicates more than one parent. since children typically rely on both parents for their well-being, the plural form is needed in this context.
1. "in a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. the phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but the specificity of "the" makes it sound literal. instead of referring figuratively to something very simple, it would mean something that is literally inside a nutshell.
1. the preposition "about" is unnecessary in this context and should be omitted for clarity and conciseness.
2. in this context, "daily life" refers to the lives of individuals or people in general, so it should be pluralised as "daily lives."
incorrect verb form. when referring to the action of connecting people globally, the verb should be conjugated in the third person singular form, which is "connects."
1. the definite article "the" is not needed before "social media" because it is referring to a general concept rather than a specific instance.
2. the preposition "in" should be used to indicate the method of contacting friends, instead of using "with."
1. incorrect pluralization. the correct form is "add-ons" because there are multiple entertainment features being referred to, so it needs to be made plural.
1. starting a sentence with "the" makes it less clear and more abrupt. use a transition word like "however" to indicate a change or contrast.
2. incorrect form of the verb. it should be "use" instead of "using" in this context.
3. the phrase "on us" does not make sense in this context. use "over us" to indicate control or influence.
4. "on" is the wrong preposition to show control or influence. use "over" to convey the intended meaning.
incorrect word choice. the sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".
1. this is a spelling error. the correct spelling is "believe".
1. after the word "discourages," the correct preposition to use is "from." the phrase should be "discourages from making." 
2. the conjunction "and" is used to connect two independent clauses. in this sentence, there are two separate ideas being conveyed that should be connected with "and."
3. the use of "will" is redundant in this context. the sentence is discussing a current situation and does not need to imply future action.
1. the possessive form "other's" is not necessary in this sentence as it is not clear whose permission is being referred to. it should be omitted.
2. the word "this" is vague in this context. it should be replaced with a more specific noun like "technology" to make the sentence clearer.
3. the word "to" is incorrect in this context. the correct word to use when discussing the placement or implantation of something is "in."
the error in this sentence is that "years" should be singular, as the time period mentioned is only one year. it should be "year ago" instead of "years ago".
1. the verb "think" is used to express an opinion or belief in the present tense. in this context, the speaker is expressing their current opinion, so the correct verb to use is "think" instead of "thought."
1. verb tense agreement error. the action of transferring to the companies should be in the past tense to match the action of recording in the server.
1. the verb is misspelled. the correct spelling is "showing."
2. the word "experience" should be in the plural form "experiences" to match the plural noun "pictures."
1. when comparing two things, the comparative form "more" should not be used with the adjective "easy." "easier" is the correct form to indicate a comparison of ease between finding old friends through facebook and asking people around in real life.
1. before the noun "internet," the definite article "the" should be used in english.
1. the preposition "with" indicates association or involvement. however, in this context, the intended meaning is the direction of facing, so the correct preposition is "to" in this case. when "face" is used as a verb to describe the direction something is pointed, it is followed by the preposition "to."
2. the phrase "talk with to other" is not grammatically correct. it should be "talk to each other" or "talk with each other." both are acceptable for indicating a conversation between multiple people.
1. the word "element" should be singular because "most essential" is referring to a single, primary element.
1. the verb "happen" should be used in the present simple form to indicate a repeated or recurring action, so "happens" is the correct form.
2. the sentence was referring to countries in general, rather than a specific country, so the article "the" is not needed.
3. the sentence is talking about countries in general, so the plural form "countries" should be used instead of "country".
4. the verb should agree with the plural subject "countries," so "are" should be used instead of "is".
5. the word "back" is unnecessary in this context and can be removed.
the error here is that the subject "procedures" is a plural noun, so the correct form of the noun that follows should be singular. the noun "challenge" should be used instead of "challenges" for subject-verb agreement.
1. the concept of "privacy issues" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. it takes the plural form to indicate that there are multiple aspects to consider.
2. the subject here is the plural "privacy issues," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "have."
3. the correct phrase is "in the first place" to indicate the original or initial situation, rather than "at the first place."
1. the subject "both of his parents" is plural, so the verb should be plural as well, which is "have" instead of "has."
2. & 3. the correct preposition to use when referring to being affected by a risk is "at" rather than "under."
4. the correct spelling is "running" not "runing."
1. the sentence is referring to a specific generation, the next generation, so the definite article "the" is necessary.
1. in this case, the word "people" is used in a general sense, referring to individuals in society, rather than specific individuals. therefore, the definite article "the" is unnecessary before "people."
1. "shall" suggests a future action and is not suitable for this context. "should" is more appropriate in expressing a recommendation or prediction.
2. "for" is used to indicate purpose, but in this context, "to" is more appropriate to show the intended recipient of the availability.
3. the use of "or" is more fitting in this context as it presents two alternatives - either not easily available to the public or taken for granted.
1. the phrase "corporate world" is a specific term and should be preceded by "the" to make it clear that it refers to a specific environment, rather than just any corporate setting.
2. in this context, social media is made up of various platforms such as facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. therefore, the plural form "networks" should be used instead of the singular "network" to refer to all these different platforms.
3. the use of the gerund "spending" is necessary here because it serves as the object of the infinitive "to prevent." this construction requires the -ing form of the verb.
1. unnecessary word. "more" should be followed directly by "the" when comparing quantities.
2. incorrect preposition. when referring to the amount of time spent on a specific type of platform, "on" should be used instead of "in."
1. the phrase "despite of" is incorrect. it should be "despite" without the preposition "of".
1. in this context, "social media" is being used as a general concept and not referring to specific social media platforms. when discussing broader concepts or categories, the definite article "the" is not necessary, so it should be removed.
1. "moral" refers to an individual's sense of right and wrong, while "morals" refer to the principles or habits with respect to right or wrong behavior. in this sentence, it should be "morals" as a plural form is needed.
2. the article "the" is not needed before "personal moral" because it's referring to a general concept, not something specific.
1. in this case, the error is that the article "a" before "birthday wishes" is unnecessary. the correct phrase is "send birthday wishes" without the article "a" before "birthday."
1. the word "thoughts" should be used in the plural form because the sentence refers to more than one thought being expressed.
2. the word "personality" should be used in the singular form as it refers to an individual's overall character.
1. the sentence is referring to the lives of people in general, not just one person's life. therefore, "lives" should be used to indicate that the statement applies to multiple individuals.
1. the correct preposition to use in this context is "by" when talking about the method or means through which one can understand a person. "with" would imply using something else to help you understand the person, rather than simply stalking their facebook page.
1. in this context, it is specific which right decision the parents will make, so the definite article "the" should be used.
1. the concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. it takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of contemporary society instead of the concept in general.
2. the noun "relationship" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. in this context, it refers to the connections between individuals, so it should be pluralized as "relationships" to indicate multiple connections.
1. in this context, the word "knowledge" is not countable, so the article "a" should be removed for correctness. knowledge is considered an uncountable noun that does not require an article to be used before it.
1. this is a spelling error. the correct spelling is "obvious."
1. the subject "social media" is singular, therefore the singular form of the verb "does" should be used instead of "do."
1. the verb "shy" does not need the preposition "for" after it. the correct structure is "be shy or afraid of".
1. the use of "but" in the original sentence implies a contrast between neglecting people and communicating with friends. however, in this context, the intention is to show that neglecting people leads to only communicating with friends. therefore, "and" is the appropriate conjunction to use to show the connection between neglecting people and solely communicating with friends.
1. missing word. the singular noun "policy" needs an article before it to make the sentence grammatically correct. use "an" before "effective policy".
1. the phrase "past decades" refers to a general period of time in the past, so the definite article "the" is unnecessary. when referring to decades in general terms like this, the article is typically omitted.
2. the verb "are" is in the present tense, but the sentence is describing a past situation. to maintain consistency in verb tense, it should be changed to "were" to indicate that the situation existed in the past.
3. the verb "connect" is in the present tense, but the sentence is describing a past action. to maintain consistency in verb tense, it should be changed to "connected" to indicate that people connected with others in the past.
4. the verb "live" is in the present tense, but the sentence is describing people who lived far away in the past. to maintain consistency in verb tense, it should be changed to "lived" to indicate that people were living far away in the past.
1. each individual inherits two copies of each gene, one from each parent. therefore, the plural form "genes" is used when referring to multiple genes altering, rather than the singular "gene". in this context, altering genes involves modifying multiple genes within an organism.
1. in academic writing, it is common to refer to a field of study without using the definite article "the." this is because the field of study is seen as a broader concept that does not need to be specified.
1. the use of the definite article 'the' before "face-to-face human contacts" makes it sound like there is a specific set of contacts that has decreased in importance, rather than the general concept of contact itself.
2. "contact" is the appropriate noun in this context, as it refers to the act of communicating with or influencing someone, whereas "contacts" typically refers to a list of people one knows or can network with.
1. use "research" when referring to the collective body of work or the process of conducting research. the plural form "researches" is not typically used in this context.
2. the subject "research" is singular, so the verb "show" should be "shows" to agree with the singular subject.
1. the preposition "for" is used to show the purpose or beneficiary of having a skill, in this case, writing.
1. incorrect preposition. the correct phrase is "discriminate against" someone, rather than "discriminate them". the use of "against" in this context shows the directionality of the discriminatory behavior.
1. a period should be used to separate the two independent clauses "and after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life" and "products such as rfid tracking systems have become real" instead of a comma.
2. the noun "systems" should be used instead of "system" because it refers to multiple rfid tracking systems.
1. in the original sentence, the subject "expressing themselves appropriately" is singular, so the verb should be singular as well. the correct form is "becomes."
1. the word "internet" is a specific noun and should be preceded by the definite article "the".
1. "each other" refers to "two individuals" while "each others" is incorrect. therefore, the right expression is "each other," which means multiple people are interacting with each other.
2. the correct term to use in this context is "role" instead of "aspect" because "role" refers to the function or part played by a person or thing in a particular situation. in contrast, "aspect" refers to a particular part or feature of something.
1. unnecessary article. when referring to society in a general sense, it does not require an article.
1. the possessive form of a name ending in "s" requires an apostrophe and an additional "s" after it, e.g., "forest's view." this is known as the "double possessive" or "s-genitive" case, and it helps to clarify that the view belongs to forest specifically.
1. confusion between countable and uncountable nouns. the correct plural form of "length" in this context is "lengths" because it refers to the various ways or levels of effort people put into making their words shorter. the uncountable noun "length" would be used to refer to a specific measurement.
2. the adjective "short" should be used instead of "shorter" because the comparison is not necessary in this sentence. the intended meaning is that people strive to make their words as brief as possible, not that they are comparing the length of their words to anything else.
1. "dignosis" is a misspelling of the word "diagnosis." 
2. "seconly" is a misspelling of the word "secondly."
1. the phrase "a discovery under an accidental case" is awkward and unclear. it is better to use the more precise and commonly understood term "the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery."
2. the preposition "under" is incorrect in this context. it should be replaced with "in" to show that the invention comes about as a result of the discovery.
1. the correct phrase is "the better habit" because it specifies a particular type of habit that is preferred. use "the" instead of "a" in this context.
1. the definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "as the result" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. if there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a result," which implies that the outcome is one of several.
1. there is only one type of support being discussed here, so it should be singular.
1. unnecessary word. when you mention "research" in general, you do not need the article "a".
2. unnecessary word. when referring to research in general, the article "the" is not necessary.
3. unnecessary word. the sentence already flows better without the additional article "the".
1. the phrase "risk for a genetic disorder" should be followed by the preposition "of" instead of "to" to show possession or association.
1. the nouns "computer," "laptop," and "tablet" are countable nouns, so they need to be pluralized in this context.
2. the word "the" is needed before the word "internet" because it refers to a specific internet network.
3. the verb "did" should be changed to "do" to make the sentence grammatically correct.
1. the comma after "is that" is unnecessary and should be removed as it disrupts the flow of the sentence.
2. "relfected" is a misspelling of "reflected" and should be corrected for accuracy and clarity.
1. the preposition "on" is used to show the topic of a discussion or to indicate what is being worked on, but in this case, the intended meaning is to express disagreement with a particular viewpoint or opinion, which requires the preposition "with" to show the target of the disagreement.
2. the word "statement" refers to a definite or clear expression of something, while "argument" refers to a reason or set of reasons given with the aim of persuading others. since this sentence is referring to a particular viewpoint or opinion, "statement" would be more appropriate than "argument" here.
1. the word "with" here is unnecessary and causes the sentence to be more verbose. it does not add any meaning or clarity to the sentence, so it should be removed.
2. the subject here is "existence," which is singular, so the verb should agree with it. the singular form "has" should be used instead of "have."
1. the correct preposition to use here is "on" as it indicates the relationship between the subjects and their usage of social media and the internet.
2. the definite article "the" is not necessary here because it refers to social media and the internet in general, not specific instances.
1. the preposition "with" is necessary in this sentence to show that social media provides people with a method or tool for talking and chatting. it indicates the means or instrument used for communication.
1. the phrase "interpersonal skills" is a general concept and does not require the definite article "the" before it in this context.
1. the article "a" is needed before the noun "need" to indicate that a need exists.
1. the article "the" is needed before the word "time" because it refers to a specific period of time, the time spent away from screens. the phrase "the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone" is more precise and grammatically correct.
1. "lesser" is used when comparing two things, with one being inferior in quality or quantity compared to the other. in this case, "less" should be used because we are comparing percentages of the population in singapore and china in terms of quantity, not quality. 
2. when talking about countries in general terms, we do not use "the" before their names. instead of saying "the china," it should be "china," and similarly for other countries.
1. the word "the" is missing before "latest news and updates." this article specifies that the news and updates being referred to are the most recent ones, rather than just any news and updates, making it more clear and specific.
1. the phrase "high chance of carrying certain disease" is correct, as the verb "indicates" is followed by "of" when expressing possibilities or chances.
2. "carry" is a verb in its base form, but after the auxiliary verb "may" in this context, you need the gerund form "carrying". the use of the gerund form is appropriate because it follows the modal verb "may".
1. spelling error. the correct spelling is "emotional."
1. the phrase "more convenient contact environment" requires the indefinite article "a" before "more" to indicate that it is one of potentially many convenient contact environments.
1. redundancy. "discuss about" is incorrect as "discuss" already implies talking about something. therefore, "about" should be omitted.
2. the phrase "in the contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. it takes the definite article only when referring to specific societies instead of to society in general.
1. the concept of "privacy" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. it takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances of privacy invasion, instead of privacy in general.
2. the phrase "invading human privacy" implies that the technology is actively violating privacy rights. to more accurately describe the technology's role, the word "safeguarding" should be used, as it means to protect or secure.
3. the concept of "benefits and security" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. it takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances of benefits and security, which are not mentioned in the sentence.
1. the term "genetic" is already referring to genes, so the word "gene" is redundant in this context.
2. "gene" should be in its plural form "genes" to match the subject "some."
1. the subject "many people" is plural, so the verb should also be plural. "says" is the third person singular form, while "say" is the third person plural form, which matches the subject "many people."
2. similar to the explanation above, "the social media" is a general concept and does not require the definite article "the." the correct phrasing is "support social media" as it refers to social media as a whole.
1. "passed" is the past tense of the verb "pass". since this sentence is referring to a general truth or a hypothetical situation, the present tense "passes" should be used to indicate that it is an ongoing or potential occurrence.
1. the word "skill" should be pluralised as this sentence is referring to the general concept of interpersonal skills.
2. the verb "are" should be used because it agrees with the plural noun "skills."
1. the correct preposition to use in this case is "on," not "in." the concept of people having profiles on social media platforms is better represented by the preposition "on" than "in."
2. the definite article "the" is not needed in this sentence. the sentence talking generally about many people on social media platforms does not require the definite article before "people."
3. the plural form of "image" should be used because we are talking about multiple images that individuals have on their social media pages.
4. just like the first error, the appropriate preposition to use in this context is "on," not "in." the phrase "on their pages" is consistent with the concept of online profiles.
5. the correct form is "he or she may not have jobs" - the use of "may do not have" is ungrammatical. the construction "do not have" is incorrect in this context and should be replaced with "not have" to reflect the possibility of people lacking jobs.
1. the sentence is referring to a specific time in the past, so the verb "was" should be used to indicate that the medical treatment technology was not advanced enough during that specific time.
1. the word "society" is being treated as a general concept here, so the definite article "the" is not needed before it.
1. this is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. it means that something is currently occurring or in progress. this construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. the adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." it does not need a preposition.
3. when referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. the singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.
1. "human" is singular, while "humans" is the plural form and makes more sense in this context.
2. since "humans" is plural, the verb "have" should be used instead of "has" to agree with the subject.
1. missing article. the phrase should be "via the internet" to specify the means of communication.
2. pronoun agreement. the possessive pronoun "her" does not match the subject of the sentence "he" which requires the possessive pronoun "his" to refer to his own daughter.
1. the phrase "seeking out" already includes the idea of looking for and finding something, so the preposition "for" is redundant and should be removed.
1. the verb "claimed" is in the past tense, while the sentence is discussing something that teenagers do in general, not something that happened in the past. therefore, the verb should be in the present tense, "claim."
1. subject-verb agreement error. "advantages" is a plural noun, so the verb should also be plural, hence "come" is used instead of "comes".
2. "application" should be pluralised to match the plural noun "sites". 
3. the correct preposition to use when referring to using something on a smartphone is "on", as in "on our smartphones".
1. "check" should be pluralized to "checks" to match the plural subject "people" in the sentence.
1. this sentence needs a gerund after the preposition "although," so use "spending" instead of "spend."
2. the article "the" is needed before "internet" as it refers to a specific online environment.
1. the definite article "the" is used before "engineering design process" to specify which process is being referred to. this indicates that the process being discussed is specific to engineering.
2. the verb "fused" is unnecessary and should be removed to avoid redundancy.
3. the preposition "on" should be removed to maintain correct sentence structure.
4. the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear and does not fit within the context of the sentence. it should be removed to improve clarity and coherence in the sentence.
1. the verb "put" is used to indicate placing someone in a certain situation or condition, in this case, in danger. the verb "get" does not convey the same action or meaning in this context, so it should be replaced with "put".
1. the correct word to use in this context is "loss," not "lost." "loss" is a noun that refers to the state or fact of losing something, while "lost" is the past tense and past participle of the verb "lose."
1. "the main cause of" is the correct phrase, indicating that greenhouse gases are what is causing global warming, not the cause to global warming.
2. "gives" should be used because the subject "cause" is singular, requiring the singular form of the verb.
1. the use of "in" is unnecessary in this sentence. removing it creates a cleaner and more concise sentence.
1. the use of "an" is correct before the word starting with a vowel sound "unhealthy" instead of "a" before a vowel sound.
2. the second "the" is necessary before "end" to match the structure of the sentence.
1. the error is the use of two blank spaces after the comma. in english, a proper place for a comma in a sentence is immediately followed by a word or two-letter space. therefore, there should only be one space after the comma in this sentence.
2. "in particularly for" is incorrect in this sentence. the correct term should be "particularly," which means "especially" or "specially." the word "especially for" is an idiom which can be replaced by particularly. this error involves a phrase that does not exist. the writer likely intended to use the phrase "particularly for."
3. in the context of studying, children are typically referred to as either children or students. "small children" is an appropriate term in this context when distinguishing them from children or students who may be older or of a different stature. however, when referring to children in general, using "the" before "small children" makes it sound like there is only one group of small children, likely a specific group referenced earlier in the text. to make it more general and include all small children as a group, "the" should be removed from this sentence.
1. the list of design processes should be separated by commas to clearly delineate each step.
the word "media" is a plural noun that refers to various forms of mass communication. when used to describe platforms like facebook or instagram, it should be in the singular form "social media" instead of "social medias."
1. incorrect use of the definite article. the concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and does not need the definite article in this sentence.
2. incorrect plural form. "contact" in this context is being used to refer to the act or instance of communicating with someone in person, so it should not be in plural form.
1. the sentence is talking about research in general, so "a" is not needed before it.
2. the sentence is referring to research as a general concept, so "the" is not necessary before it.
3. the sentence is talking about lives in general, so "the" is not needed before it.
1. the use of "but" suggests a contrast or contradiction between neglecting people surrounding them and communicating with friends on facebook. however, the intention of the sentence is to show a continuation or addition of actions, so "and" should be used instead of "but".
1. the plural "dinners" implies multiple separate meals, while the singular "dinner" refers to the evening meal typically eaten by a family. in this context, it should be "having dinner" to refer to the single meal being consumed by the family.
this is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. it should be the plural "dilemmas" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential ethical issues.
1. the verb "is" belongs to the present tense, so the verb "give" that follows it should also be in the present tense, which is "gives."
1. the sentence is referring to social network sites as a plural concept, so it should be "sites" instead of "site" to reflect this plurality.
1. "hard times" is a common phrase that refers to difficult situations or challenges. it is always used in the plural form.
1. "chatting" is a gerund and does not require the preposition "on" after it. therefore, "on" should be removed.
2. "skills" should be in the plural form because the sentence is referring to multiple interpersonal abilities.
1. the preposition "on" is required after "rely" to show the dependency relationship.
2. the verb "rely" should be followed by the plural noun "parents" to match the subject "children" in the sentence.
1. in this context, "cause" should be used as the main verb to match the structure of the sentence.
1. in this case, "the" should be omitted before "manufacture company" because we are referring to the specific company that the innovators are working for, not just any specific manufacture company.
1. in this context, "a burden" is used to refer to any burden, rather than a specific burden. therefore, the indefinite article "a" should be used instead of the definite article "the".
the preposition "in" is used to refer to something contained within a physical location or medium, like a newspaper. in this case, the story is inside the newspaper, not on it.
1. the error here is the unnecessary use of "if" before "agrees." the sentence should read "which method... is suited best for the purpose and agrees with existing international laws." the "if" is not needed because it creates uncertainty, but the sentence is describing a decision-making process in which the engineer is expected to make a decision that agrees with international laws.
1. the definite article "the" is unnecessary before the plural noun "innovators" because it is being used in a general sense, referring to innovators as a group rather than specific individuals.
