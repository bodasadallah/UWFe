Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle. 




Error_sentence: On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Correct_sentence: On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Prediction: 
1. On the other side → On the other hand
2. as stated above → as stated above
3. a person who want to confirm → a person who wants to confirm
4. and has been prepared to face the result → and has been prepared to face the result
5. can choose to do the genetic testing individually → can choose to do the genetic testing individually
cleaned: 1. On the other side → On the other hand
2. as stated above → as stated above
3. a person who want to confirm → a person who wants to confirm
4. and has been prepared to face the result → and has been prepared to face the result
5. can choose to do the genetic testing individually → can choose to do the genetic testing individually
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Error_sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct_sentence: One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .
Prediction: 
1. The subject of the sentence is “One of the disadvantages that many people concerns”, not “One of the disadvantage that many people concerns”.
2. There is a comma missing after “disadvantages”.
3. There is a comma missing before “that”.
4. There is a comma missing before “people”.
5. There is a comma missing before “lose”.
6. There is a comma missing before “the”.
7. There is a comma missing before “interest”.
8. There is a comma missing before “of”.
9. There is a comma missing before “face-to-face”.
10. There is a comma missing before “communication”.
11. There is a comma missing before “.”.
cleaned: 1. The subject of the sentence is “One of the disadvantages that many people concerns”, not “One of the disadvantage that many people concerns”.
2. There is a comma missing after “disadvantages”.
3. There is a comma missing before “that”.
4. There is a comma missing before “people”.
5. There is a comma missing before “lose”.
6. There is a comma missing before “the”.

8. There is a comma missing before “of”.
9. There is a comma missing before “face-to-face”.
10. There is a comma missing before “communication”.
11. There is a comma missing before “.”.
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.




Error_sentence: I agree that RFID technology shall not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
Correct_sentence: I agree that RFID technology should not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .

6. Shall not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage -> should not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.

Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Prediction: 
1. There is a comma splice in the erroneous sentence. A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are separated by a comma. In the erroneous sentence, “Researches show that” and “face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing” are two independent clauses that are separated by a comma.
2. There is a comma splice in the erroneous sentence. A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are separated by a comma.

Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Correct_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason for the halt of the work was that the higher level authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .

3. The reason for the halt of the work was that the higher level authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
4. The reason for the halt of the work was that the higher level authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.

Label: 1. Missing word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".

Correct_sentence: To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .

6. The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .
7. The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .
Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.




Error_sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .
Correct_sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child .

Error_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .
Correct_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers from making more effort to do research and design , and they have little motivation to work hard .
Prediction: 
1. engineers to make more effort to do research and design -> engineers from making more effort to do research and design
2. engineers to make more effort to do research and design -> engineers from making more effort to do research and design
3. engineers to make more effort to do research and design -> engineers from making more effort to do research and design
4. engineers to make more effort to do research and design -> engineers from making more effort to do research and design
5. engineers to make more effort to do research and design -> engineers from making more effort to do research and design
cleaned: 1. engineers to make more effort to do research and design -> engineers from making more effort to do research and design
2. engineers to make more effort to do research and design -> engineers from making more effort to do research and design
3. engineers to make more effort to do research and design -> engineers from making more effort to do research and design
4. engineers to make more effort to do research and design -> engineers from making more effort to do research and design
5. engineers to make more effort to do research and design -> engineers from making more effort to do research and design
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."

2. You should explicitly state "technology" for clarity.
3. An implant goes inside the body, so you need to use "in" accordingly.

4. I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore -> I started invoving into Facebook one year ago,when I just arrived singapore

Label: 1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.

5. In the erroneous sentence, there is a comma after the word ‘Singapore’. In the corrected sentence, there is no comma after the word ‘Singapore’.
Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.

Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.

Error_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
Correct_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
Prediction: 
1. In the erroneous sentence, the word ‘shall’ has been used instead of ‘should’.
2. In the erroneous sentence, the word ‘or’ has been used instead of ‘and’.
3. In the erroneous sentence, the word ‘taken’ has been used instead of ‘taking’.
4. In the erroneous sentence, the word ‘for’ has been used instead of ‘to’.
5. In the erroneous sentence, the word ‘public’ has been used instead of ‘the public’.
6. In the erroneous sentence, the word ‘taken’ has been used instead of ‘taking’.

4. In the erroneous sentence, the word ‘for’ has been used instead of ‘to’.
5. In the erroneous sentence, the word ‘public’ has been used instead of ‘the public’.
6. In the erroneous sentence, the word ‘taken’ has been used instead of ‘taking’.
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.

9. In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees to spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."




Error_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .

10. Based on the statistic report , the more the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used on the social media sites .
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Error_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Correct_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .

Label: 1. Unnecessary word. If you were using "in spite" it would be okay to write "in spite of the distance", but "of" is not necessary when using "despite".

Label: 1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."

Label: 1. The singular noun "thought" refers to a single idea or opinion. For example, "I think I'd like eggs for breakfast" or "She thinks it would be fun to try beekeeping" are two thoughts. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "thoughts" should be pluralized.
2. The singular noun "personality" means a collection of traits, behaviors, or emotional qualities that make up an individual's character. The plural noun "personalities" refers to the personalities of multiple people.

2. When referencing relationships as a general concept, the plural "relationships" should be used because it references multiple relationships between many different people. The singular "relationship" is used to refer to individual relationships, with "a relationship" meaning any relationship and "the relationship" meaning one relationship specifically.

Label: 1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."

Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.

Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.

These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."

Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".

Error_sentence: People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
Correct_sentence: People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
Prediction: 
1. It should be “great lengths” and not “great length”.
2. It should be “as short as they can” and not “as shorter as they can”.
3. It should be “as short as they can” and not “as short they can”.
4. It should be “as short as they can” and not “as short they can”.

5. It should be “as short as they can” and not “as short they can”.
6. It should be “as short as they can” and not “as short they can”.
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".

2. the relatives of the carrier -> the relatives of the carrier
3. can also choose to do genetic testing -> can also choose to do genetic testing

Label: 1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "diagnosis".

8. “Serendipity is usually defined as the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery , and it often results in the invention of a new technology .”
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.

Label: 1. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and "the computer" meaning one computer specifically.
2. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing laptops as a general concept, the plural "laptops" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "laptop" is used to refer to an individual laptop, with "a laptop" meaning any laptop and "the laptop" meaning one laptop specifically.
3. The plural noun "tablet" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing tablets as a general concept, the plural "tablets" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "tablet" is used to refer to an individual tablet, with "a tablet" meaning any tablet and "the tablet" meaning one tablet specifically.
4. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.
5. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "did" implies that the phone is no longer involved in people's work, so it should be the present tense "do" instead.

Label: 1. If you "agree on" something it usually means you reach a compromise with someone. When talking about an opinion and saying whether you agree or disagree, "agree" is usually followed by the preposition "with".
2. Incorrect word choice. This is an opinion/assertion that is being stated, so use "statement".

Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".




Error_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Correct_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Prediction: 
1. The erroneous sentence is grammatically incorrect because it contains a comma splice. A comma splice occurs when a comma is used to join two independent clauses without using a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet) or a semicolon. In the erroneous sentence, the comma is used to join the two independent clauses “With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet” and “a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world”.
2. The erroneous sentence is also grammatically incorrect because it contains a run-on sentence. A run-on sentence occurs when two or more independent clauses are joined without using a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet) or a semicolon. In the erroneous sentence, the two independent clauses “With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet” and “a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world” are joined without using a coordinating conjunction or a semicolon.
3. The erroneous sentence is also grammatically incorrect because it contains a dangling modifier.

In the erroneous sentence, the modifying phrase “With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet” does not clearly modify the intended word or phrase.
4. The erroneous sentence is also grammatically incorrect because it contains a misplaced modifier. A misplaced modifier occurs when a modifying phrase or clause is placed in such a way that it does not clearly modify the intended word or phrase.

2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.

Label: 1. The adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted.

Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.

Prediction:

4. There are many people on social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages , however in real life , he or she may not have jobs or live poorly .
Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.

Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.

Correct_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Prediction: 
1. "Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location" is grammatically incorrect because the verb "claimed" does not agree with the subject "Many of the teenagers today".
2. "Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location" is grammatically incorrect because the verb "claim" does not agree with the subject "Many of the teenagers today".

6. "Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location" is grammatically incorrect because the verb "claim" does not agree with the subject "Many of the teenagers today".
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.

Error_sentence: Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .
Correct_sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to .
Prediction: 
1. The erroneous sentence contains a dangling modifier.
2. The erroneous sentence contains a comma splice.
3. The erroneous sentence contains a comma splice.
4. The erroneous sentence contains a comma splice.
5. The erroneous sentence contains a comma splice.
cleaned: 1. The erroneous sentence contains a dangling modifier.
2. The erroneous sentence contains a comma splice.
3. The erroneous sentence contains a comma splice.
4. The erroneous sentence contains a comma splice.
5. The erroneous sentence contains a comma splice.
Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."

Label: 1. The phrase "put in danger" is a common expression and the verb does not change. The verb "put" means to cause someone to be in a particular place or position.

4. The main cause to worldwide global warming should be the main cause of worldwide global warming.
5. The main cause to worldwide global warming should be the main cause of worldwide global warming.
Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.

2. The erroneous sentence has a comma splice error.

4. The erroneous sentence has a comma splice error.
5. The erroneous sentence has a comma splice error.
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".

It should be rephrased as “According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes , which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .”
3. The third error is that the sentence is not grammatically correct. It should be rephrased as “According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes , which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .”
Label: 1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.

cleaned: 1. Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.

Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner. A meal is still referred to in the singular when it is shared by multiple people. Therefore, it should be "having dinner" rather than "having dinners."

Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".

Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.

2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

Correct_sentence: With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and statuses .
Prediction: 
1. "at school , at work or at home" -> "at school , work or home"

Error_sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .
Correct_sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay for another year in the secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top student in his province .
Prediction: 
1. The secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .
2. The secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top student in his province .

5. The secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.

Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.

7. Social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them.
Label: 1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".

Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.
