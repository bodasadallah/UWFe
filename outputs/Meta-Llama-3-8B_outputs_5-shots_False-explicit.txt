Prediction:  1. "Resource" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "resource", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".
Erroneous sentence: Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
Correct sentence: Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences .
Explanations:
1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."
2. The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.

cleaned: 1. "Resource" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "resource", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle. 




Error_sentence: On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Correct_sentence: On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Prediction:  1. "Other side" is a physical location, not a concept, so it is not correct to use it here. The correct expression is "other hand".
2. "Want" is a verb, not a noun, so you need to use the verb form here.
3. "Has been prepared" is a passive construction, so you need to use the passive form of the verb "to choose".
Erroneous sentence: I think that the people in Singapore is very kind and helpful .
Correct sentence: I think that the people in Singapore are very kind and helpful .
Explanations:
1. The subject here is "people," which is plural, so the verb should be "are" for subject-verb agreement.
Erroneous sentence: The first and the most important reason is because the social media has been used in the wrong way .
Correct sentence: The first and most important reason is because social media has been used in the wrong way .
Explanations:
1. "First and the most important" is redundant. The correct expression is "first and most important".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
3. Missing word. The correct expression is "has been used".
Err
cleaned: 1. "Other side" is a physical location, not a concept, so it is not correct to use it here. The correct expression is "other hand".
2. "Want" is a verb, not a noun, so you need to use the verb form here.
3. "Has been prepared" is a passive construction, so you need to use the passive form of the verb "to choose".
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Error_sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct_sentence: One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .
Prediction:  1. "Loss" is a verb, so it should be "lose" instead. 2. "Concerns" is a verb, so it should be "concerned" instead. 3. "Interest" is a noun, so it should be "interest in" instead.
Erroneous sentence: Social media are a great tool to keep in touch with our family and friends , but it also has a lot of negative effect on our lives .
Correct sentence: Social media are a great tool to keep in touch with our family and friends , but it also has a lot of negative effects on our lives .
Explanations:
1. "Effects" is the plural form of "effect", so it should be "effects" instead.
Erroneous sentence: These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Correct sentence: These social media makes people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Explanations:

Erroneous sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem .
Correct sentence: While , once
cleaned: 1. "Loss" is a verb, so it should be "lose" instead. 2. "Concerns" is a verb, so it should be "concerned" instead. 3. "Interest" is a noun, so it should be "interest in" instead.
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.




Error_sentence: I agree that RFID technology shall not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
Correct_sentence: I agree that RFID technology should not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 




Error_sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Correct_sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Prediction:  
1. "Reimbursement" is a noun, and therefore should not have the verb "is".
2. "For" should be used before the noun "cash reimbursement" to indicate the reason for the action.
Erroneous sentence: For example , when the social media sites are used by people who are in the same field , they can share their knowledge with each other and exchange their ideas .
Correct sentence: For example , when people in the same field use social media sites , they can share their knowledge with each other and exchange their ideas .
Explanations:
1. "When" is used to indicate the time at which something happens, and "while" is used to indicate the time during which something happens. In this case, "when" is used because the author is discussing the time at which people in the same field use social media sites.
2. "Field" is an uncountable noun, and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.
3. "Field" is an uncountable noun, and therefore should not have an article.
4. "Field" is an uncountable noun, and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.
5. "Field" is an uncountable noun
cleaned: 1. "Reimbursement" is a noun, and therefore should not have the verb "is".
2. "For" should be used before the noun "cash reimbursement" to indicate the reason for the action.
Label: 1. The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.




Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Prediction:  1. "Researches" is plural, but "show" is singular, so it should be "research."
Erroneous sentence: The findings of the researches show that the use of social media is more popular among the younger generation .
Correct sentence: The findings of the research show that the use of social media is more popular among the younger generation .
Explanations: 1. "Researches" is plural, but "show" is singular, so it should be "research."

Correct sentence: The findings of the research show that the use of social media is more popular among the younger generation .
Explanations: 1. "Researches" is plural, but "show" is singular, so it should be "research."
Err
cleaned: 1. "Researches" is plural, but "show" is singular, so it should be "research."
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Correct_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason for the halt of the work was that the higher level authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.

cleaned: 
Label: 1. Missing word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".

Correct_sentence: To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Prediction:  
1. The phrase "to put it in a nutshell" means "to summarize the main point in a few words." The word "nutshell" is a metaphor for a small box that contains a nut. The metaphor is not used in the phrase, so the word "the" should not be used.
Erroneous sentence: However , the communication between parents and their children should be kept confidential .
Correct sentence: However , communication between parents and their children should be kept confidential .
Explanations:
1. The phrase "between parents and their children" is a prepositional phrase that modifies "communication." The phrase should be placed as close as possible to the word it modifies. 
Erroneous sentence: Moreover , the genetic test result should be shared among family members .
Correct sentence: Moreover , the genetic test result should be shared among family members .
Explanations:
1. The phrase "among family members" is a prepositional phrase that modifies "shared." The phrase should be placed as close as possible to the word it modifies. 
Erroneous sentence: In addition , it is important to note that the genetic testing result should be kept confidential .
Correct sentence: In addition , it is important to note that the genetic testing result should be kept
cleaned: 1. The phrase "to put it in a nutshell" means "to summarize the main point in a few words." The word "nutshell" is a metaphor for a small box that contains a nut. The metaphor is not used in the phrase, so the word "the" should not be used.
Label: 1. "In a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. The phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but the specificity of "the" makes it sound literal. Instead of referring figuratively to something very simple, it would mean something that is literally inside a nutshell.

Correct_sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .
Prediction:  1. "Over" means "above," "beyond," or "on top of," and is used to indicate spatial location. "On" is used to indicate a point of contact. In this sentence, the use of "over" implies that people are literally standing above us, but that is not the intended meaning. The use of "on" implies that people are using the internet on us, which is the intended meaning.
2. "Us" is a pronoun, and pronouns are always singular. The word "people" is a plural noun. Therefore, the pronoun must be plural as well.

2. "Us" is a pronoun, and pronouns are always singular. The word "people" is a plural noun. Therefore, the pronoun must be plural as well.
Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.

Error_sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .
Correct_sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child .
Prediction:  1. The word "their" is a possessive pronoun, which means that it refers to the object that it possesses. In this sentence, "their" refers to "parents," which is plural. Therefore, the possessive pronoun should be "their," not "theirs." 2. The word "have" is a verb, which means that it should be conjugated to match the subject.

Correct sentence: As time passes , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
Explanations:
1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.

Correct_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers from making more effort to do research and design , and they have little motivation to work hard .
Prediction:  1. The phrase "for they" is awkward. It should be "and they."
2. The verb "have" is used for possession, so it is incorrect to use it to describe a situation. "Have" should be changed to "have little motivation to work hard."
Erroneous sentence: As a result , we can see that the students have less interest in science and technology , which may lead to the lack of talented people in the future .
Correct sentence: As a result , we can see that students have less interest in science and technology , which may lead to a lack of talented people in the future .
Explanations:
1. The phrase "As a result" is used to introduce the conclusion of a piece of writing. In this case, the conclusion is that students have less interest in science and technology, so "As a result" should be placed before that conclusion, not after it.
2. The phrase "which may lead to the lack of talented people in the future" is awkward. It should be "which may lead to a lack of talented people in the future."
Erroneous sentence: In the end , the conclusion is that the students are more interested in social media and the Internet , which is not a good thing for
cleaned: 1. The phrase "for they" is awkward. It should be "and they."
2. The verb "have" is used for possession, so it is incorrect to use it to describe a situation. "Have" should be changed to "have little motivation to work hard."
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."

The phrase "without other's permission" is incorrect because you should not use the possessive form of the word "other" with the word "permission". 3. "This" refers to the technology, so it should be singular. 4. "Placed" and "implanted" are both verbs, so you need to change the verb to agree with the subject. 5. "This technology" is singular, so the verb should be singular. 6. "Anyone" is singular, so the verb should be singular. 7. "This technology" is singular, so the verb should be singular.
Erroneous sentence: If you are going to be late for work , please call your manager and inform him about it .
Correct sentence: If you are going to be late for work , please call your manager and inform him or her about it .
Explanations:

3. The pronoun "him" is singular

Correct_sentence: Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .

Erroneous sentence: The problem with this is that it is not always clear how much time is required to complete the project .
Correct sentence: The problem with this is that it is not always clear how much time is required to complete the project .
Explanations:
1. The word "this" in the sentence refers to the whole sentence before it. It is not referring to a specific part of the sentence, so it is not necessary to add "that" to it.
Erroneous sentence: However , we can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
Correct sentence: However , we can not deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .

Error_sentence: Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
Correct_sentence: Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences .
Prediction:  1. The verb "show" is in the present tense, so the third person singular form of the verb is "shows". Also, the noun "experience" is plural, so it should be "experiences".

Correct sentence: However , there are also some people who share their private information on social media such as their real names , phone numbers , email addresses and home addresses .
Explanations: 1. When we talk about a specific person, we use the definite article, i.e. "the", before their name. For example, "The name of the person is John." If we are talking about a group of people, we use the indefinite article, i.e. "a", before their name. For example, "A name of a person is John."
2. When we talk about a specific phone number, we use the definite article, i.e. "the", before it. For example, "The phone number is 12345678." If we are talking about a group of phone numbers, we use the indefinite article, i.e. "a",

Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."
2. The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.

Correct_sentence: Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is easier than asking people around in real life .
Prediction:  1. The comparative adjectives "more" and "less" are used for two things that are being compared. In this sentence, you are comparing "finding old friends through Facebook" and "asking people around in real life." You are not comparing the ease of "finding old friends" and the ease of "asking people." If you wanted to compare the ease of finding old friends, you would use "easier" and "harder," respectively. However, since you are comparing the ease of finding old friends through Facebook and the ease of asking people around in real life, you must use "more" and "less." 2. "More" is an adjective, so it must be followed by a noun. "Easier" is an adjective, so it must be followed by a noun.

Correct_sentence: However , since the internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Prediction:

Error_sentence: It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other .
Correct_sentence: It is weird that people sit around the table but all face their phones and do not talk with to other .
Prediction:  1. "To" is a preposition, and it requires an object. In this case, the object is "other." "Other" is an adjective, so it requires a noun. "Other" cannot be used alone as a noun, so the correct way to use it is "other people."
2. The word "each" means "every one of two or more." The phrase "each other" is used to refer to two or more people, or two or more things, who are interacting with each other. When there is only one person or one thing, the phrase "to each other" is used.

Label: 1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.




Error_sentence: That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
Correct_sentence: That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
Prediction:  1. The word "elements" is a plural noun, so it should be changed to the singular "element" because it is the most important factor in overcoming the challenges.
Erroneous sentence: The policy makers should take these considerations into account when they are planning to make the policy .
Correct sentence: The policy makers should take these considerations into account when they are planning to make the policy .
Explanations: 1. The preposition "into" is used to indicate movement or transfer from one place or state to another. Because the policy makers are already planning to make the policy, they have already transferred from not planning to planning, so the preposition "into" is not appropriate here. The preposition "for" should be used instead to indicate the purpose of the action.
Erroneous sentence: In the other hand , the policy makers should consider the consequences of the policy they are making .
Correct sentence: In the other hand , the policy makers should consider the consequences of the policy they are making .
Explanations: 1. The preposition "in" is used to indicate movement or transfer from one place or state to another. Because the policy makers are already considering the consequences of the policy, they have already transferred from not considering to considering
cleaned: 1. The word "elements" is a plural noun, so it should be changed to the singular "element" because it is the most important factor in overcoming the challenges.
Label: 1. The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.

Correct_sentence: Since this happens more often in countries which are much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child without knowing where the child has been brought to .
Prediction:  
1. "Happen" is a transitive verb, which means that it requires a direct object. "Happen" can be used with "to" or "for" as a preposition, but not with "to". The sentence should be rephrased to avoid the use of "to". For example, "Since this happens more often in countries which are much larger than Singapore, it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child without knowing where the child has been brought to."
2. "It" is a pronoun, and it must be a subject or an object. "It" cannot be a subject in the sentence, so the pronoun must be replaced with a noun.

Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.

Correct_sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenge for the innovators .
Prediction:  The word "challenges" is plural, so it should be used with a plural verb.
Erroneous sentence: The term " eugenics " is usually associated with the Nazi Germany 's use of sterilization and killing of the disabled and the mentally ill .
Correct sentence: The term " eugenics " is usually associated with the Nazi Germany 's use of sterilization and killing of the disabled and the mentally ill .
Explanations:
1. The phrase "usually associated with" is a common collocation. It is not necessary to use "is usually associated with" in the sentence, since the subject is already a singular noun.
2. The phrase "the Nazi Germany's" is a common collocation. It is not necessary to use "the Nazi Germany's" in the sentence, since the subject is already a singular noun.

Prediction:  1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".

Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.




Error_sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Correct_sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Prediction:  1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "As the genetic risk may pass down to next generation" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a genetic risk may pass down to the next generation," which implies that the outcome is one of several.

Erroneous sentence: The lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Correct sentence: The lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Explanations:
1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.

cleaned: 1. The singular "people" refers to a group of people as a whole. The plural "people" refers to each individual person.
Label: 1. The concept of "people" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of people instead of to people in general.




Error_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
Correct_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
Prediction:  1. The sentence is discussing the availability of RFID technology. It's not talking about RFID technology itself, but the availability of it. So "available" should be used instead of "available for".

cleaned: 1. The sentence is discussing the availability of RFID technology. It's not talking about RFID technology itself, but the availability of it. So "available" should be used instead of "available for".
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.

Correct_sentence: In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees to spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Prediction:  1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.
2. The word "network" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
3. "Prevent" is a transitive verb and therefore needs an object. "Employees" is the object of the verb "prevent".
4. "Their" is the possessive form of "they". You are referring to the employees, not the employers.
Erroneous sentence: Thus , people are easily addicted to the social media and they spend most of their time on the social media .
Correct sentence: Thus , people are easily addicted to social media and they spend most of their time on social media .
Explanations:
1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

4. "Their" is the possessive form of "they". You are referring to the employees, not the employers.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."

Explanations: 1. The more is an adverb, and it should be placed after the verb it is modifying, which is "will be reduced." 2. The verb "used" should be followed by the preposition "on" instead of "in". 3. The phrase "the more time" is an adverbial phrase, and it should be placed after the verb it is modifying, which is "used."

cleaned: 1. The more is an adverb, and it should be placed after the verb it is modifying, which is "will be reduced." 2. The verb "used" should be followed by the preposition "on" instead of "in". 3. The phrase "the more time" is an adverbial phrase, and it should be placed after the verb it is modifying, which is "used."
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Error_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Correct_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. If you were using "in spite" it would be okay to write "in spite of the distance", but "of" is not necessary when using "despite".




Error_sentence: Therefore , the social media is truly good for people .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , social media is truly good for people .
Prediction:  1. "Therefore" is used to indicate that the following statement is a conclusion based on the previous statement. In this case, the sentence is not a conclusion, so "therefore" should not be used.

Error_sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Correct_sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal moral morals the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Prediction:  1. The noun "moral" means relating to the principles of right and wrong. The noun "morals" is the plural form of "moral." The sentence is using the plural form to show that the duty of informing at-risk relatives depends on the moral standards of each individual. 2. The adjective "directive" means giving orders or instructions. The sentence is using the adjective in the comparative form, "more directive," to show that the duty of informing at-risk relatives depends on the degree of risk involved. 3. The phrase "to them" is a prepositional phrase. It is used to show that the risk is to the relatives, not to the person informing them.

Label: 1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."

Correct_sentence: For example , we tend send birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .

Correct_sentence: It means that one can not know another 's real thoughts and personality by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
Prediction:  1. The phrase "real thought" is redundant, and "thoughts" is more commonly used in this context. The word "personalities" is not a commonly used word in this context, and the phrase "real personality" is redundant, so I suggest using the word "personality" without "real".
Erroneous sentence: However , I think a person should have a right to decide whether to tell his or her family about the risk or not .
Correct sentence: However , I think a person should have a right to decide whether to tell his or her family about the risk or not .
Explanations: 1. The phrase "I think" is used in the sense of an opinion that you hold now, not something that you thought in the past, so you should use the present tense, "think".
Erroneous sentence: It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other .

cleaned: 1. The phrase "real thought" is redundant, and "thoughts" is more commonly used in this context. The word "personalities" is not a commonly used word in this context, and the phrase "real personality" is redundant, so I suggest using the word "personality" without "real".
Label: 1. The singular noun "thought" refers to a single idea or opinion. For example, "I think I'd like eggs for breakfast" or "She thinks it would be fun to try beekeeping" are two thoughts. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "thoughts" should be pluralized.
2. The singular noun "personality" means a collection of traits, behaviors, or emotional qualities that make up an individual's character. The plural noun "personalities" refers to the personalities of multiple people.

Correct_sentence: One can not truly understand a person by only stalking his/her facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present .
Prediction:  1. The phrase "not truly understand" is redundant. "Truly" means "in a genuine way" or "in a sincere manner". The phrase "not truly" is redundant.
2. The phrase "by only stalking" is redundant. "Stalking" means to follow someone in a way that makes them feel threatened or harassed. The phrase "by only stalking" is redundant.

Error_sentence: Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed .
Correct_sentence: Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make the right decision after they have be informed .
Prediction:  1. The phrase "make a right decision" is incorrect. The word "right" should be an adjective describing the decision. "Right" can be used as an adjective, but it is used in a different context. The word "right" can be used to describe something that is correct or just, but it can also be used to describe something that is on the right side of something else. The phrase "make a right decision" is used to describe the decision as being on the right side of something else, but this is not what is meant here. Instead, "right" should be used as an adjective to describe the decision as being correct or just. 2. The phrase "have be informed" is incorrect. The verb "have" should be used with a past participle, but "be" is not a past participle. Instead, "have" should be used with the past participle "been." 3. The phrase "will make the right decision" is incorrect. The phrase "will make" should be used with the past tense of the verb "make," which is "made."

Prediction:  
1. "Social media" is singular and so should be followed by singular verbs.
2. The phrase "in the contemporary society" is redundant. You can simply say "in contemporary society" as it is implied that this is the current society.

Erroneous sentence: However , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Correct sentence: However , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Explanations:
1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.
cleaned: 1. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
2. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.

Correct_sentence: Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
Prediction:  
1. "Though" is a subordinating conjunction which requires the verb in the dependent clause to be in the singular form. "Social media" is singular, so the verb "do" must be changed to "does." 
2. The plural "relationships" must be changed to singular "relationship" because the verb "do" is singular.

Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.

Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The noun "policy" requires either an article or pluralization. The definite article "the" refers to a specific policy, especially one that was mentioned earlier in the text. Because no such policy was mentioned, it should be changed to the indefinite article "a," which refers to one single unspecified policy out of multiple potential policies, or alternately to the plural "policies," which means multiple unspecified policies.

Correct_sentence: In past decades , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Prediction:  1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "were" implies that the social media sites are no longer under development, so it should be the present tense "are" instead.
Erroneous sentence: The most common and popular social media sites are Facebook , Instagram , and Twitter .
Correct sentence: The most common and popular social media sites are Facebook , Instagram , and Twitter .
Explanations: 1. The noun "social media" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing social media sites as a general concept, the plural "sites" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "site" is used to refer to an individual site, with "a site" meaning any site and "the site" meaning one site specifically.

2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."

Prediction:  
1. "Face-to-face" is a phrase meaning in person. The phrase "face-to-face human contacts" is redundant and can be shortened to "face-to-face contact." 
2. The verb "decrease" is in the present tense, but the subject "importance" is in the singular. This is not grammatically correct. "Decrease" should be in the singular, as "importance" is. 
3. "Decresed" is a misspelling of "decreased," which is the past tense of "decrease."

2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.

Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."

Erroneous sentence: People will feel more comfortable to talk to people who are from the same race or culture .

Correct_sentence: More and more networking has been transferred to the internet from real life .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Error_sentence: With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life .

Prediction:  
1. "People" is a general concept, so it does not take the indefinite article "a."
2. "Each other" is a commonly used phrase, so it never takes the article "the."
3. The phrase "more important role" is commonly used, so it never takes the article "a."
Erroneous sentence: There are many people that think that social media is a way to connect to the world , but actually it is a way to isolate people from the world .
Correct sentence: There are many people that think that social media is a way to connect to the world , but actually it is a way to isolate people from the world .
Explanations: 
1. "Many people" is a general concept, so it does not take the indefinite article "a."
2. The phrase "is a way to" is a commonly used expression, so it never takes the article "the."
Erroneous sentence: According to the article , social media is not only for connecting people , but also for making people feel lonely .

2. "Each other" is a commonly used phrase, so it never takes the article "the."
3. The phrase "more important role" is commonly used, so it never takes the article "a."
Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".




Error_sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
Correct_sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows .
Prediction:  1. "Society" is singular, so it should be singularised as "society".
cleaned: 1. "Society" is singular, so it should be singularised as "society".

Error_sentence: Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue .
Correct_sentence: Here I want to share Forest 's view on this issue .
Prediction:  1. An "s" and a space are missing. There should be an "s" after the apostrophe and "view" should be a separate word.
Erroneous sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .
Correct sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation , particularly small children who are studying in nursery .
Explanations: 1. Add a comma to separate the clauses. 2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own. 3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.
Erroneous sentence: It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other .
Correct sentence: It is weird that people sit around the table but all face their phones and do not talk with to other .

Error_sentence: People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
Correct_sentence: People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
Prediction:  1. The phrase "go to great lengths" is idiomatic, and "great length" is a singular noun. Therefore, the plural "lengths" is incorrect.
Erroneous sentence: This is a big problem for the family and the individual , because of the fear of the disease , people tend to take more medicine in order to prevent the disease .
Correct sentence: This is a big problem for the family and the individual , because of the fear of the disease , people tend to take more medicine in order to prevent the disease .
Explanations: 1. The indefinite article "a" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "problem." Either "problem" or "a problem" would be acceptable.
Erroneous sentence: This is because the people are not aware of the fact that they have a certain risk , thus they are not aware of the factor that they need to be careful with .
Correct sentence: This is because the people are not aware of the fact that they have a certain risk , thus they are not aware of the factor that they need to be careful about .
Explanations: 1. The phrase "be careful with" is idiomatic and does not generally take an object. The correct phrase is "
cleaned: 1. The phrase "go to great lengths" is idiomatic, and "great length" is a singular noun. Therefore, the plural "lengths" is incorrect.
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".




Error_sentence: Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .
Correct_sentence: Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier .

Error_sentence: Serendipity is usually defined as a discovery under an accidental case , and it often results the invention of a new technology .
Correct_sentence: Serendipity is usually defined as the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery , and it often results in the invention of a new technology .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.

Prediction:

Error_sentence: As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Correct_sentence: As a result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Prediction:  1. Incorrect word choice. "As a result" is used to indicate the result of an action, whereas "as the result" is used to indicate the result of an event. In this case, the result of an action is more appropriate, so "as a result" should be used instead.
Erroneous sentence: In this case , the parents 's right to know the healthiness of their child is more important than the carrier 's right to privacy .
Correct sentence: In this case , the parents ' right to know the healthiness of their child is more important than the carrier 's right to privacy .

1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".
2. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".

Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "As the result" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a result," which implies that the outcome is one of several.

It generally refers to actions or gestures, which are not tangible and cannot be counted. The word "supports" is a verb form or a noun referring to the structural components of a building that allow it to withstand force.

1. Incorrect preposition. As "risk" is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".

4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "tablets."
5. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "internet."
Label: 1. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and "the computer" meaning one computer specifically.
2. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing laptops as a general concept, the plural "laptops" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "laptop" is used to refer to an individual laptop, with "a laptop" meaning any laptop and "the laptop" meaning one laptop specifically.
3. The plural noun "tablet" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing tablets as a general concept, the plural "tablets" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "tablet" is used to refer to an individual tablet, with "a tablet" meaning any tablet and "the tablet" meaning one tablet specifically.
4. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.
5. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "did" implies that the phone is no longer involved in people's work, so it should be the present tense "do" instead.

Correct sentence: The fact that the majority of people are using social media for the purpose of entertainment and not for any meaningful communication , human interaction is decreasing .
Explanations:
1. "The" is used to refer to a specific thing. As this sentence is referring to the purpose of using social media, "the" is used to refer to the specific purpose of using social media.
2. "Human" is singular, so you need to use the singular verb "is" to go with it.

"With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".

2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

Error_sentence: Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Prediction:  
1. The phrase "there is a need" is correct. The phrase "there is need" is incorrect. The word "need" is a noun, so it needs to be preceded by the article "a" to form the phrase "a need." The phrase "there is a need" is also correct because it is a complete phrase.
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.

There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.




Error_sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Correct_sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Prediction:  
1. "Hence" means "therefore" or "thus," so it is used to indicate the cause and effect relationship between the previous sentence and the current one. Since "Hence" is used to show the cause and effect relationship, it should be followed by a noun or pronoun that is the subject of the next sentence, so it should be "it" and not "it's."
2. "Time" is singular, so it should not be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Correct sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .
Explanations:
1. "But" should be used in the situation where you do one thing, but not the other, so you could say, "they don't speak to the people around them, but do communicate with friends on Facebook," but in the context of your sentence, you are saying that both these actions are going on at the same time, so you should use "and", as in they
cleaned: 1. "Hence" means "therefore" or "thus," so it is used to indicate the cause and effect relationship between the previous sentence and the current one. Since "Hence" is used to show the cause and effect relationship, it should be followed by a noun or pronoun that is the subject of the next sentence, so it should be "it" and not "it's."
2. "Time" is singular, so it should not be pluralised.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.




Error_sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than five percent of the population in the China .
Correct_sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than five percent of the population in China .
Prediction:  
1. The phrase "1000 times lesser" is not grammatically correct. The word "less" is an adjective that is used to describe a noun. In this case, "1000 times lesser" is an adverb modifying the verb "is." The correct phrase is "1000 times less."
Erroneous sentence: This is a problem that will not be solved in the near future .
Correct sentence: This is a problem that will not be solved in the near future .
Explanations:
1. The phrase "in the near future" is an adverbial phrase that modifies the verb "will not be solved." The phrase "in the near future" is redundant because the future tense "will not be solved" already implies that the action will occur in the future. It is best to delete the phrase "in the near future" because it is redundant.
Erroneous sentence: This is a problem that will not be solved in the near future .
Correct sentence: This is a problem that will not be solved in the near future .

cleaned: 1. The phrase "1000 times lesser" is not grammatically correct. The word "less" is an adjective that is used to describe a noun. In this case, "1000 times lesser" is an adverb modifying the verb "is." The correct phrase is "1000 times less."
Label: 1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.

Correct_sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance of carrying certain disease .
Prediction:  1. The word "indicates" is a verb, so it should be conjugated to the third person singular, "indicates".
2. The word "carry" is a verb, so it should be conjugated to the third person singular, "carries".
3. The word "certain" is an adjective, so it should be followed by the singular noun "disease".
Erroneous sentence: Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .
Correct sentence: Although surveillance technology is an issue in safeguarding human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .

2. None
3. The sentence is discussing human privacy in general, so it does not require an article.

Correct sentence: When electronic devices are not grounded properly , there is a probability that the user might get an electric shock when he/she accidentally comes into contact with the device .
Explanations
cleaned: 1. The word "indicates" is a verb, so it should be conjugated to the third person singular, "indicates".
2. The word "carry" is a verb, so it should be conjugated to the third person singular, "carries".
3. The word "certain" is an adjective, so it should be followed by the singular noun "disease".
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.




Error_sentence: Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts .

Correct sentence: I do not think it is a good idea to put the children in the same class because they are not the same age .

Error_sentence: It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
Correct_sentence: It provides people with a more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is used when something exists in an unspecified manner or amount, or to express one out of multiple options. The phrase "convenient contact environment" means one potential environment out of many, with varying degrees of convenience. This condition is best expressed by the indefinite article "a."




Error_sentence: This essay will discuss about both the benefits and down sides of using social media in the contemporary society .
Correct_sentence: This essay will discuss both the benefits and down sides of using social media in contemporary society .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The verb "discuss" does not take the preposition "about." While "about" is used with similar verbs like "tell" or "talk," in the case of "discuss," the object simply comes directly after, with no need for a preposition.
2. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.




Error_sentence: Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .
Correct_sentence: Although surveillance technology is an issue in safeguarding human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .
Prediction:  
1. "Safeguarding" is a more appropriate word than "invading" because the surveillance technology is not used to attack the privacy of people. It is used to protect people's privacy. "Safeguarding" is a more common word to describe this process.
Erroneous sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
Correct sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
Explanations:
1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas

Error_sentence: Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Correct_sentence: Some genes will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Prediction:  1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "pass" to go with "genes".
Erroneous sentence: The first step is to develop a clear and specific definition of the problem , the second step is to gather information on the problem and the third step is to generate possible solutions .
Correct sentence: The first step is to develop a clear and specific definition of the problem , the second step is to gather information on the problem and the third step is to generate possible solutions .
Explanations: 1. "Develop" is a verb that is used to talk about creating or making something new, so it should not be used in the sense of "to define." Instead, the word "define" should be used.
Erroneous sentence: In this case , it is not the genetic information that is the problem , but rather the social and ethical issues surrounding the use of genetic information .
Correct sentence: In this case , it is not the genetic information that is the problem , but rather the social and ethical issues surrounding the use of genetic information .
Explanations: 1. "Genetic information" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: The first step is to develop a clear and specific
cleaned: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "pass" to go with "genes".
Label: 1. The adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted.
2. The word "some" means an unspecified amount or a large amount. It is usually used with plural nouns. Also, it is unlikely that there is only one gene that can only be inherited by a specific gender, so logically it is more likely to be the plural.

Error_sentence: As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
Correct_sentence: As time passes , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
Prediction:  1. The verb "to pass" is a transitive verb, which means it requires an object to complete its meaning. In this case, "time" is the object of the verb "to pass." However, the verb "to pass" is also used intransitively, in which case it does not require an object. In the sentence "As time passes," the verb "to pass" is used intransitively. 2. "Friends" is a countable noun, so it takes the indefinite article "a." 3. "Time" is a countable noun, so it takes the indefinite article "a." 4. The concept of "friends" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific group of friends, instead of the concept in general.

Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.

Correct_sentence: In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .

1. The word "skill" is singular, so it takes the singular verb "is" in the present tense. The word "skills" is plural, so it takes the plural verb "are" in the present tense.
Erroneous sentence: The only way to make the world a better place is to start from the bottom and work your way up .
Correct sentence: The only way to make the world a better place is to start from the bottom and work your way up .
Explanations:

Erroneous sentence: The main reason of the failure of the project is that the company did not have enough resources to complete the project .
Correct sentence: The main reason for the failure of the project is that the company did not have enough resources to complete the project .

1. The phrase "of the failure" is modifying the word "project," so it should be the possessive form "project's." The word "project" is singular, so it takes the singular verb "is" in the present tense
cleaned: 1. The word "skill" is singular, so it takes the singular verb "is" in the present tense. The word "skills" is plural, so it takes the plural verb "are" in the present tense.

Correct_sentence: There are many people on social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages , however in real life , he or she may not have jobs or live poorly .
Prediction:  1. The subject is "people," which is plural, so the verb should be plural for subject-verb agreement. 2. The phrase "in the social media" is redundant and unnecessary. The prepositional phrase "on social media" is sufficient to show that the people are on social media. 3. The phrase "in their pages" is redundant and unnecessary. The prepositional phrase "on their pages" is sufficient to show that the images and content are on the pages. 4. The phrase "he or she may do not" is incorrect. The verb "may" is a modal verb, and it is followed by the base form of the verb, so it should be "he or she may not." 5. The phrase "he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly" is incorrect. The phrase "he or she may not have jobs or live poorly" is correct. 6. The phrase "he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly" is incorrect.

Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.

Erroneous sentence: The social media sites are a way to express yourself and you can share your opinion and your feelings with others .
Correct sentence: The social media sites are a way to express yourself and you can share your opinion and feelings with others .

4. The phrase "contact my old friend" is not a grammatically correct expression. The verb "contact" is usually used with an object, meaning to
Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.




Error_sentence: Human has their own rights and privacy .
Correct_sentence: Humans have their own rights and privacy .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".




Error_sentence: He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet .
Correct_sentence: He can even talk to his daughter face-to-face using video call via the internet .
Prediction:  1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the internet in general, not a specific one. The definite article conveys that the internet in question was used in general, not for other things.
Erroneous sentence: If the user wants to upload the picture , he/she can do it in the album .
Correct sentence: If the user wants to upload the picture , he/she can do it in an album .
Explanations:
1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the album in general, not a specific one. The definite article conveys that the album in question was used in general, not for other things.
Erroneous sentence: She is the one who is responsible for her own privacy .
Correct sentence: She is responsible for her own privacy .
Explanations:
1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to her own privacy in general, not a specific one. The definite article conveys that her own privacy in question was used in general, not for other things.
Erroneous sentence: There are some people who do not know how to use the
cleaned: 1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the internet in general, not a specific one. The definite article conveys that the internet in question was used in general, not for other things.
Label: 1. Missing article. "Internet" is the name of a specific network, so use the definite article, "the".
2. The sentence starts with "He", referring to man, but the third person possessive you have used is the female version. Change to "his" to match with "He" and make it clear that you are talking about a man.




Error_sentence: There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Correct_sentence: There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Prediction:  1. The phrase "seeking out" is redundant, as "seeking" means "to search for." The phrase "seeking out" would mean "searching for and finding."
2. "One's" is the possessive form of the pronoun "one". When the possessive form of a pronoun is used, the word "one" is not repeated. For example, "one's" is the possessive form of "one", so you would not say "one's one's opinion".
Erroneous sentence: There is a need to change the education system so that it can better prepare the students for the future .
Correct sentence: There is a need to change the education system so that it can better prepare students for the future .
Explanations:
1. "The" is the definite article, and it is used to indicate that the noun it precedes is one specific thing. In this case, "the education system" is not specific, because there are many different education systems in the world. Therefore, "the" should be omitted.
2. "Can" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "can better prepare", should be used.
Errone
cleaned: 1. The phrase "seeking out" is redundant, as "seeking" means "to search for." The phrase "seeking out" would mean "searching for and finding."
2. "One's" is the possessive form of the pronoun "one". When the possessive form of a pronoun is used, the word "one" is not repeated. For example, "one's" is the possessive form of "one", so you would not say "one's one's opinion".
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Seek out" does not require the preposition "for" to indicate what is being sought out.




Error_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Correct_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Prediction:  1. Use "claim" instead of "claimed" because the sentence is talking about the general idea that teenagers can keep in touch with their friends regardless of their location.
Erroneous sentence: Social media also provide a platform for people to share their views and ideas .
Correct sentence: Social media also provides a platform for people to share their views and ideas .
Explanations:
1. Use "provides" instead of "provide" because it is a single action, and "provides" is the third-person singular form of the verb "to provide."
Erroneous sentence: In the case of Facebook , it is also a social network that has been widely used by people around the world .
Correct sentence: In the case of Facebook , it is also a social network that has been widely used by people around the world .
Explanations:
1. Use "is" instead of "has been" because Facebook is still in use and not a past action.
Erroneous sentence: Social media is a technology that has been used by people to communicate with each other .
Correct sentence: Social media is a technology that has been used by people to communicate with each other .
Explanations:
1. Use "is" instead of "has been" because social
cleaned: 1. Use "claim" instead of "claimed" because the sentence is talking about the general idea that teenagers can keep in touch with their friends regardless of their location.
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.




Error_sentence: These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones .
Correct_sentence: These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "come" to go with "advantages".
2. The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.
3. We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".




Error_sentence: Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
Correct_sentence: Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional checks or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
Prediction:  
1. Incorrect form. "Announcement" is the noun form, but you need to use the verb form, "announce".
2. Incorrect form. "Creats" is the past tense of "create", but the sentence is talking about a future event, so you need the future tense, "will create".
Erroneous sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Correct sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Explanations:
1. Missing article. As our planet is a countable noun but also the only one we know of, we call it "the world".
2. Incorrect form. "Latest" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the noun "news", so you need to use the adverb form, "latest".
Erroneous sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Correct sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative
cleaned: 1. Incorrect form. "Announcement" is the noun form, but you need to use the verb form, "announce".
2. Incorrect form. "Creats" is the past tense of "create", but the sentence is talking about a future event, so you need the future tense, "will create".
Label: 1. From the sentence we can surmise that the people would have more than one check, so the plural "checks" should be used.




Error_sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Correct_sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spending too much time on the internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Prediction:  1. The verb "spend" means to use or waste time or money, so it is not appropriate to use "spend" when talking about spending time on the internet. "Spend" should be changed to "spending."
2. The plural noun "factors" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing factors as a general concept, the plural "factors" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "factor" is used to refer to an individual factor, with "a factor" meaning any factor and "the factor" meaning one factor specifically.
Erroneous sentence: In conclusion , the potential negative factors of using online social networks is the unsafe online environment , and spend too much time on internet .

Label: 1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.




Error_sentence: Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .
Correct_sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to .
Prediction:  1. "Either" is used to introduce two alternatives. In this sentence, the two alternatives are "an entirely new system" and "improvising on the current." 2. "To" is a preposition that means "in the direction of" or "in order to reach." In this sentence, "to" is used to indicate that the engineering design process is being developed in order to reach a desired end. 3. "Cater" means "to provide or supply something." In this sentence, the engineering design process is being developed in order to provide or supply a desired end.
Erroneous sentence: This paper will also highlight the importance of the engineer 's role in the design process and how the process itself can be improved .
Correct sentence: This paper will also highlight the importance of the engineer 's role in the design process and how the process itself can be improved .
Explanations: 1. The phrase "the engineer's role" is singular, so it should be followed by a singular verb. 2. The phrase "the design process" is singular, so it should be followed by a singular verb.
Erroneous sentence: This paper will also highlight the importance of the engineer 's role in the
cleaned: 1. "Either" is used to introduce two alternatives. In this sentence, the two alternatives are "an entirely new system" and "improvising on the current." 2. "To" is a preposition that means "in the direction of" or "in order to reach." In this sentence, "to" is used to indicate that the engineering design process is being developed in order to reach a desired end. 3. "Cater" means "to provide or supply something." In this sentence, the engineering design process is being developed in order to provide or supply a desired end.
Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."

Correct_sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger ?
Prediction:

Correct_sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The verb "cause" is always followed by a noun, and "lost" is the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed to the noun "loss." 




Error_sentence: These green house gases are the main cause to worldwide global warming which give rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Correct_sentence: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Prediction:  
1. The subject "These greenhouse gases" is plural. It must be in the plural, "are," not the singular "is."
2. This sentence is referring to the past, as shown by the phrase "give rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature." The present tense "give" implies that the catastrophes are still occurring, so it should be the past tense "gave" instead.
Erroneous sentence: The technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
Correct sentence: The technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering genes is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
Explanations:
1. The technology to alter genetic material could be applied not just to a single gene but any and all genes. For that reason, it's correct to use the plural "genes" rather than the singular "gene."
2. This sentence is referring to the past, as shown by the phrase "The technology has been developed." The present tense
cleaned: 1. The subject "These greenhouse gases" is plural. It must be in the plural, "are," not the singular "is."
2. This sentence is referring to the past, as shown by the phrase "give rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature." The present tense "give" implies that the catastrophes are still occurring, so it should be the past tense "gave" instead.
Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.




Error_sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
Correct_sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The statement is confusing two phrases: "keep confidential" and "in confidence." The phrase "keep confidential" is common and is used without variation in wording.




Error_sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have a unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage .
Correct_sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
Prediction:  1. The adjective "unhealthy" means not healthy, so "unhealthy" should be used in place of "a unhealthy".
2. The phrase "the end of their marriage" means the end of their marriage, so "the end of their marriage" should be used in place of "end of their marriage".
Erroneous sentence: For example , when a man is the carrier of a genetic disease , he may not want to tell his wife about it , but if she is the carrier of the same disease , she will know about it when she is pregnant .
Correct sentence: For example , when a man is the carrier of a genetic disease , he may not want to tell his wife about it , but if she is the carrier of the same disease , she will know about it when she is pregnant .
Explanations:
1. The word "example" is a singular noun, so the subject-verb agreement is "is" rather than "are".
2. The word "pregnant" is a singular noun, so the subject-verb agreement is "will know" rather than "will know about".
Erroneous sentence: The man may not want to tell his wife about it , but if she is the carrier of the same disease ,
cleaned: 1. The adjective "unhealthy" means not healthy, so "unhealthy" should be used in place of "a unhealthy".
2. The phrase "the end of their marriage" means the end of their marriage, so "the end of their marriage" should be used in place of "end of their marriage".
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".




Error_sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .
Correct_sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation , particularly small children who are studying in nursery .
Prediction:  1. This sentence has two problems. The first is that it is talking about a specific action that can protect students, but it is not clear what that action is. It is therefore best to make the action the subject of the sentence, and then the students are the objects of the action. The second problem is that "particularly" should be placed before "small children", as it is the small children who are being particularly protected.

Label: 1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.

Prediction:  1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.

Error_sentence: Personally I feel more at ease on social medias .
Correct_sentence: Personally I feel more at ease on social media .
Prediction:  1. "Media" is the plural of "medium," and is therefore uncountable. This sentence is talking about one medium, so it should be singular.
Erroneous sentence: The technology that we use today has created a virtual world where people can connect with each other .
Correct sentence: The technology that we use today has created a virtual world where people can connect with one another .
Explanations: 1. "One another" is a special construction used to refer to two or more people, especially when they are close to each other. This sentence is talking about multiple people, so "one another" is appropriate.
Erroneous sentence: In the modern world , the internet has become the most important thing in people 's life .
Correct sentence: In the modern world , the internet has become the most important thing in people 's lives .
Explanations: 1. "Life" is singular, so it should be pluralised to go with the plural "people."

Correct
cleaned: 1. None2. None3. None4. None5. None6. None7. None8. None9. None10. None
Label: 1. "Contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. When used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.




Error_sentence: Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Correct_sentence: Also , according to research , it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Prediction:  1. The phrase "according to a research" is incorrect because it is not a proper noun. Therefore, it should be changed to "according to research."
2. The phrase "this is because" is used to explain a cause for something, which is not the case here. The phrase "this is because" should be changed to "this is because of," as it is being used to explain the cause of a feeling.
Erroneous sentence: For example , a person is always thinking about what others are doing in the Facebook and then he or she feel sad when he or she notice that others are having a better life than him or her .
Correct sentence: For example , a person is always thinking about what others are doing in the Facebook and then feels sad when he or she notices that others are having a better life than him or her .
Explanations:
1. "He or she" is the plural, as it is used to refer to both male and female. Therefore, the pronoun should be changed to "he or she" to be consistent with the singular "person."
2. The phrase "notice that" is used to indicate the action of noticing something. Therefore, the phrase "notice that" should be changed to "notice."

cleaned: 1. The phrase "according to a research" is incorrect because it is not a proper noun. Therefore, it should be changed to "according to research."
2. The phrase "this is because" is used to explain a cause for something, which is not the case here. The phrase "this is because" should be changed to "this is because of," as it is being used to explain the cause of a feeling.
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.

Correct_sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. "But" should be used in the situation where you do one thing, but not the other, so you could say, "they don't speak to the people around them, but do communicate with friends on Facebook," but in the context of your sentence, you are saying that both these actions are going on at the same time, so you should use "and", as in they shun/ignore the people around them AND only communicate with friends on Facebook.

Correct_sentence: A family of four having dinner in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .
Prediction:  
1. Incorrect word. "Dinners" is a plural noun, but "having dinner" is a singular verb. "Having dinners" is a plural verb. 
2. Incorrect form. "Having" is a verb, and is used with the infinitive form of another verb, so you need to use "to" with "chatting" in the sentence.
cleaned: 1. Incorrect word. "Dinners" is a plural noun, but "having dinner" is a singular verb. "Having dinners" is a plural verb.
2. Incorrect form. "Having" is a verb, and is used with the infinitive form of another verb, so you need to use "to" with "chatting" in the sentence.
Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner. A meal is still referred to in the singular when it is shared by multiple people. Therefore, it should be "having dinner" rather than "having dinners."




Error_sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma .
Correct_sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. This is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. It should be the plural "dilemmas" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential ethical issues. 




Error_sentence: If your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Correct_sentence: If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "gives" to go with "wife".




Error_sentence: With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network site now become a place to show off .
Correct_sentence: With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network sites now become a place to show off .
Prediction:  
1. "Social network site" is an uncountable noun and should not have the article "the."
2. The word "willing" means a desire to do something, but it is not commonly used in modern English. The word "willingness" is a more commonly used word to express this meaning.
cleaned: 1. "Social network site" is an uncountable noun and should not have the article "the."
2. The word "willing" means a desire to do something, but it is not commonly used in modern English. The word "willingness" is a more commonly used word to express this meaning.
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about social network sites in general, so "site" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .
Correct_sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Prediction:  1. The plural form of "time" is "times." The context is that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times in your life. 2. "Because" is a conjunction, and the subject of the sentence is "it." Therefore, "that" is needed to connect the two clauses.
Erroneous sentence: The best way to learn a language is to live in a country where that language is spoken .
Correct sentence: The best way to learn a language is to live in a country where that language is spoken .
Explanations:
1. The best way to learn a language is to live in a country where that language is spoken .
2. The subject of the sentence is "the best way." "To" is a preposition that is used to indicate the object of a verb, so it is needed in this sentence.
Erroneous sentence: There are many factors that influence the choice of language , such as the language of the country you are living in , the language you are going to study in , the language of the people you are going to meet .
Correct sentence: There are many factors that influence the choice of language , such as the language of the country you are living in , the language you are going to
cleaned: 1. The plural form of "time" is "times." The context is that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times in your life. 2. "Because" is a conjunction, and the subject of the sentence is "it." Therefore, "that" is needed to connect the two clauses.
Label: 1. When generally referring to a period of hardship, time is pluralised, so the correct expression is "the hard times".




Error_sentence: It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected .
Correct_sentence: It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skills will be badly affected .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".
2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct_sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Prediction:  1. The verb "rely" means to depend on something or someone. The phrase "rely the parent" makes no sense. The preposition "on" is needed to make the sentence grammatically correct.
Erroneous sentence: The food safety and the health of the consumers are the most important concern of the government .
Correct sentence: The food safety and the health of the consumers are the most important concerns of the government .
Explanations: 1. The phrase "the most important concern" is incorrect. The noun "concern" is a singular noun, so it must be used with a singular verb. The noun "concerns" is a plural noun, so it must be used with a plural verb. The noun "concerns" is also used when there are multiple concerns. Since there are two concerns in the sentence, "concerns" should be used.
Erroneous sentence: The 2010 floods in Queensland were the most devastating natural disaster in the history of Australia .
Correct sentence: The 2010 floods in Queensland were the most devastating natural disaster in Australian history .
Explanations: 1. The phrase "in the history of Australia" is incorrect. The phrase "in the history of" is
cleaned: 1. The verb "rely" means to depend on something or someone. The phrase "rely the parent" makes no sense. The preposition "on" is needed to make the sentence grammatically correct.
Label: 1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
2. The subject is "children," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.




Error_sentence: This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
Correct_sentence: This could lead to psychological implications and thus cause many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
Prediction:  1. "Effects" is a plural noun, so it should be "causes" instead of "cause." 2. "Causing" is a verb, but "causes" is a noun. It is used in the sentence as a subject, so it should be "cause."
Erroneous sentence: For example , if the system is broken , the user will not be able to use the system at all .
Correct sentence: For example , if the system is broken , the user will not be able to use the system .
Explanations:
1. The sentence is saying that the user cannot use the system if it is broken. The word "at all" is redundant and unnecessary.
Erroneous sentence: As we can see , the technology has been developed very fast and it has made our lives easier .
Correct sentence: As we can see , the technology has been developed very fast and it has made our lives easier .
Explanations:
1. The word "it" should not be used to refer to "technology," as "technology" is an abstract concept and cannot be used as a subject.
cleaned: 1. "Effects" is a plural noun, so it should be "causes" instead of "cause." 2. "Causing" is a verb, but "causes" is a noun. It is used in the sentence as a subject, so it should be "cause."
Label: 1. This sentence is not talking about something that is currently happening, but something that could happen, so you need to change the present continuous "causing" to the present "cause".




Error_sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Correct_sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Prediction:  
1. "So" is used to indicate that the previous sentence is the reason for the following one. In this case, the reason for the following sentence is that the manufacturer is one of the investors, so the sentence should be "So, the manufacturer is one of the major investors that is providing the fund." In this case, "so" is not needed, as it is implied.
2. The company is not the subject of the sentence, so it should not be capitalised.
3. "For example" is used to give an example of something, so it should not be used here. You are not giving an example of a manufacturer, you are talking about the manufacturer, so just say, "for example, the company that innovators are working for."
cleaned: 1. "So" is used to indicate that the previous sentence is the reason for the following one. In this case, the reason for the following sentence is that the manufacturer is one of the investors, so the sentence should be "So, the manufacturer is one of the major investors that is providing the fund." In this case, "so" is not needed, as it is implied.
2. The company is not the subject of the sentence, so it should not be capitalised.
3. "For example" is used to give an example of something, so it should not be used here. You are not giving an example of a manufacturer, you are talking about the manufacturer, so just say, "for example, the company that innovators are working for."
Label: 1. The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of to innovators in general.




Error_sentence: Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family .
Correct_sentence: Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden in her family .
Prediction:  1. "Lots" is an adjective and therefore cannot be pluralised.
2. "Carrier" is a countable noun, so it should be pluralised to "carriers".
3. "Family" is a countable noun, so it should be pluralised to "families".
Erroneous sentence: In the end , the social media is the best way for people to communicate with each other .
Correct sentence: In the end , the social media is the best way for people to communicate with each other .
Explanations:
1. "Social media" is a countable noun, so it should not be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: In conclusion , I would like to say that the social media has changed the way of communication .
Correct sentence: In conclusion , I would like to say that the social media has changed the way people communicate .
Explanations:
1. "Communication" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralised.
2. "People" is a countable noun, so it should be pluralised to "people".
Erroneous sentence: The social media has made the world a smaller place and has helped people to be more connected with each other .
Correct sentence: The social media has made
cleaned: 1. "Lots" is an adjective and therefore cannot be pluralised.
2. "Carrier" is a countable noun, so it should be pluralised to "carriers".
3. "Family" is a countable noun, so it should be pluralised to "families".
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."




Error_sentence: I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .
Correct_sentence: I noticed a real story in newspaper years ago .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".




Error_sentence: Looking at this third step we realize why the second stage of an engineering design process of gathering information is important.Once all the information is put together into the different possible solutions , the engineer is put to decide which method out of the lot is suited best for the purpose and if agrees with existing international laws .
Correct_sentence: Looking at this third step we realize why the second stage of an engineering design process of gathering information is important.Once all the information is put together into the different possible solutions , the engineer is put to decide which method out of the lot is suited best for the purpose and agrees with existing international laws .
Prediction:  1. The phrase "agrees with existing international laws" is redundant because "agrees" means "is in agreement with." The phrase "agrees with" is a common phrase meaning "is in agreement with." The phrase "existing international laws" is a common phrase meaning "existing international laws." 2. The phrase "the engineer is put to decide" is redundant because "put to decide" means "decide." The phrase "put to decide" is a common phrase meaning "decide." 3. The phrase "out of the lot" is redundant because "out of" means "from a group." The phrase "out of the lot" is a common phrase meaning "from a group." 4. The phrase "put together into the different possible solutions" is redundant because "put together" means "to put together." The phrase "put together" is a common phrase meaning "to put together." 5. The phrase "different possible solutions" is redundant because "possible" means "capable of happening." The phrase "possible solutions" is a common phrase meaning "capable of happening." 6. The phrase "different possible solutions" is redundant because "possible" means "capable of happening." The phrase "possible
cleaned: 1. The phrase "agrees with existing international laws" is redundant because "agrees" means "is in agreement with." The phrase "agrees with" is a common phrase meaning "is in agreement with." The phrase "existing international laws" is a common phrase meaning "existing international laws." 2. The phrase "the engineer is put to decide" is redundant because "put to decide" means "decide." The phrase "put to decide" is a common phrase meaning "decide." 3. The phrase "out of the lot" is redundant because "out of" means "from a group." The phrase "out of the lot" is a common phrase meaning "from a group." 4.

The phrase "different possible solutions" is redundant because "possible" means "capable of happening." The phrase "possible
Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.




Error_sentence: These are not the only challenges that the innovators are going to deal with .
Correct_sentence: These are not the only challenges that innovators are going to deal with .
Prediction:  
1. The possessive "innovators" is used to show that the challenges are associated with the innovators, not the innovators themselves. 
2. The present tense should be used to show that the challenges are currently still happening. To create the present tense, we use "are" and the present participle "dealing with."
Erroneous sentence: The term "big brother" is a well known term from the book 1984 by George Orwell .
Correct sentence: The term "big brother" is a well known term from the book 1984 by George Orwell .
Explanations: 
1. The article "a" is used to refer to a single entity. In this case, "the book 1984" is a single entity, so "a" is not needed. 
2. The possessive "Orwell's" is used to show that the book was written by Orwell, not by someone else. 
3. The book is not a single entity, so "the book 1984" is not needed.
Erroneous sentence: The article "a" is used to refer to a single entity .
Correct sentence: The article "a" is used to refer to a single entity .
Explanations
cleaned: 1. The possessive "innovators" is used to show that the challenges are associated with the innovators, not the innovators themselves.
2. The present tense should be used to show that the challenges are currently still happening. To create the present tense, we use "are" and the present participle "dealing with."
Label: 1. The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of to innovators in general.




Error_sentence: This is the common law in the society .
Correct_sentence: This is the common law in society .
Prediction:  
1. "Society" is a noun and does not need to be capitalized.

cleaned: 1. "Society" is a noun and does not need to be capitalized.
Label: 1. As "society" is something general and uncountable, it does not need an article, so remove "the".




Error_sentence: When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
Correct_sentence: When people around us know that we got a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , whether caring for us too much or keeping away from us .
Prediction:  1. Use the preposition "for" to indicate the object of care. 2. Use the definite article "a" to refer to a specific disease. 3. Use the plural form "attitudes" to refer to the multiple attitudes of people around us.
Erroneous sentence: People who are exposed to social media for a long time are more likely to have a negative effect on their mental health .
Correct sentence: People who are exposed to social media for a long time are more likely to have a negative effect on their mental health .
Explanations: 1. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the duration of exposure to social media. 2. The adjective "negative" is used to describe the effect on mental health. 3. The phrase "on their mental health" is used to indicate the effect on the mental health of the people.
Erroneous sentence: However , it is not necessary that the person who uses the social media will be depressed .
Correct sentence: However , it is not necessary that the person who uses social media will be depressed .
Explanations: 1. Use the definite article "the" to refer to a specific person who uses social media. 2. Use the verb "will
cleaned: 1. Use the preposition "for" to indicate the object of care. 2. Use the definite article "a" to refer to a specific disease. 3. Use the plural form "attitudes" to refer to the multiple attitudes of people around us.
Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The sentence is talking about people in general, so it does not need an article.




Error_sentence: Otherwise , making it an obligation will restric the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .

Error_sentence: With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status .
Correct_sentence: With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and statuses .
Prediction:

Label: 1. The list is talking about things in general, and so "status" should be pluralised to match "conversations", "blogs" and "photos".




Error_sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .
Correct_sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay for another year in the secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top student in his province .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.




Error_sentence: These implants and products are also been used as surveillance tools .
Correct_sentence: These implants and products have also been used as surveillance tools .
Prediction:  
1. The simple past tense "been" should be changed to the present perfect tense "have been."
Erroneous sentence: In the past , many people think that the social media is a waste of time .
Correct sentence: In the past , many people thought that the social media was a waste of time .
Explanations:
1. The simple past tense "think" should be changed to the past perfect tense "thought."
Erroneous sentence: This is because , the social media can be used as a communication tool .
Correct sentence: This is because the social media can be used as a communication tool .
Explanations:
1. Unnecessary comma. The position of the comma is grammatically incorrect.
Erroneous sentence: In the past , many people think that the social media is a waste of time .

Error_sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .
Correct_sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring some negative effects on our daily lives .
Prediction:  1. "Bring" needs to be followed by a plural noun, because you are talking about multiple negative effects. 2. "Life" is uncountable, so it should not be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: Social media sites have been created to facilitate our lives .
Correct sentence: Social media sites have been created to facilitate our lives .
Explanations: 1. The word "facilitate" means "make easier", so you do not need to add the word "our" to it.
cleaned: 1. "Bring" needs to be followed by a plural noun, because you are talking about multiple negative effects. 2. "Life" is uncountable, so it should not be pluralised.
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
3. This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .
Correct_sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
Prediction:  1. "Hence" means "for this reason" or "therefore". It is not a conjunction, so it cannot be followed by a comma.
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "immediately".
Erroneous sentence: As a result , it is very important for the users to be cautious when they are using social media .
Correct sentence: As a result , it is very important for the users to be cautious when using social media .
Explanations: 1. The word "when" is followed by a verb, so it cannot be followed by "using social media".
Erroneous sentence: For instance , some people have shared their photos without knowing that it is actually a scam .
Correct sentence: For instance , some people have shared their photos without knowing that it is actually a scam .
Explanations: 1. Incorrect word. The correct word is "instance".
Erroneous sentence: In addition , it is also possible that some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
Correct sentence: In addition , it is also possible that some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share in the first place .

cleaned: 1. "Hence" means "for this reason" or "therefore". It is not a conjunction, so it cannot be followed by a comma.
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "immediately".
Label: 1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".




Error_sentence: With the aids of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily .
Correct_sentence: With the aid of social media , people bond globally , information flows rapidly , and humans live happily .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "bond" to go with "people".
2. This sentence is talking about humans in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "live" to go with "humans".
4. "Aid" used in the sense of help or assistance is an uncountable noun and therefore should not be pluralised.




Error_sentence: We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
Correct_sentence: We can not deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
Prediction:  
1. The word "really" is not necessary here. It is used in this sentence to emphasize the previous sentence, but it is not necessary because it is already clear that genetic testing helps people. You can simply remove "really" from the sentence and it will still make sense.

Label: 1. The concept of "genetic testing" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific type or instance of genetic testing, instead of the concept in general.




Error_sentence: Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
Correct_sentence: Family members , as one the closest groups of people from whom they can get comfort , are a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
Prediction: 
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so use the plural "groups".
2. This connects back to "family members" at the beginning of the sentence, so you need to use the plural, "are", as in "Family members are a crucial factor...".

Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.
