2. The phrase "human resources" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

2. The subject is "a person", which is singular, so use the third person singular "wants".
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Error_sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct_sentence: One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .
Prediction: 
1. The sentence is talking about multiple disadvantages, so use the plural "disadvantages".
2. The sentence is talking about the loss of interest in face-to-face communication, so use the definite article, "the".
3. The preposition "of" is used to indicate the object of an action, but in this case the object is "interest", so use the preposition "in" to indicate the object of the verb "lose".
Erroneous sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people .

cleaned: 1. The sentence is talking about multiple disadvantages, so use the plural "disadvantages".
2. The sentence is talking about the loss of interest in face-to-face communication, so use the definite article, "the".
3. The preposition "of" is used to indicate the object of an action, but in this case the object is "interest", so use the preposition "in" to indicate the object of the verb "lose".
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.

Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Prediction: 
1. The plural "researches" is used to refer to multiple research projects or multiple researchers. The singular "research" is used to refer to a single research project or a single researcher. In this sentence, the author is referring to a single research project, so the singular "research" should be used.

cleaned: 1. The plural "researches" is used to refer to multiple research projects or multiple researchers. The singular "research" is used to refer to a single research project or a single researcher. In this sentence, the author is referring to a single research project, so the singular "research" should be used.
2. The verb "show" is used to refer to the action of presenting or demonstrating something. The third person singular form of "show" is "shows."
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Correct_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason for the halt of the work was that the higher level authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Prediction: 
1. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is necessary (the underground traffic system) with regard to whom (the higher level of authorities).
2. The definite article "the" is used to refer to specific things. The phrase "the work" refers to the specific work that was halted, so it should be the definite article "the".
3. The definite article "the" is used to refer to specific things. The phrase "the halt of the work" refers to the specific work that was halted, so it should be the definite article "the".
4. The preposition "of" is used to indicate the relationship between the reason and the halt of work. The phrase "the reason of the halt of the work" is a redundancy and should be removed.

Errors:

2. Error: sites, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The plural noun "sites" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural.

4. The preposition "of" is used to indicate the relationship between the reason and the halt of work. The phrase "the reason of the halt of the work" is a redundancy and should be removed.
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.

Correct_sentence: To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Prediction: 
1. The noun "nutshell" is uncountable, so it does not use an article. The phrase "in a nutshell" means to summarise something, so it is common to use the indefinite article "a" to indicate any nutshell, as opposed to a specific one.

Label: 1. "In a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. The phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but the specificity of "the" makes it sound literal. Instead of referring figuratively to something very simple, it would mean something that is literally inside a nutshell.

Correct_sentence: This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives .

Error_sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .
Correct_sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .
Prediction: 
1. The word "however" is used to introduce a statement that contradicts a previous statement. It is used to contrast two things, so it should be placed at the beginning of the sentence.
2. The verb "use" is used with objects, so "use" is used when talking about the action of using something, and "using" is used when talking about the state of being used. In this sentence, the subject is "people," so the verb should be "use."
3. The preposition "over" is used to indicate that something is done to or affects something else. In this sentence, the people are using the internet to affect the people who are not using it, so "over" is used.
4. The preposition "on" is used to indicate that something is done to or affects something else. In this sentence, the people are using the internet to affect the people who are not using it, so "on" is used. This is a common error, as "on" is used when talking about the state of being affected, and "over" is used when talking about the action of affecting.

Explanations:
1. The word "however" is used to introduce a statement that contradicts a previous statement. It is used to contrast two things, so it should be placed at the beginning of the sentence.
2. The verb "use" is used with objects, so "use" is used when talking about the action of using something, and "using" is used when talking about the state of being used. In this sentence, the subject is "people," so the verb should be "use."
3. The preposition "over" is used to indicate that something is done to or affects something else. In this sentence, the people are using the internet to affect the people who are not using it, so "over" is used.
4. The preposition "on" is used to indicate that something is done to or affects something else
cleaned: 1. The word "however" is used to introduce a statement that contradicts a previous statement. It is used to contrast two things, so it should be placed at the beginning of the sentence.
2. The verb "use" is used with objects, so "use" is used when talking about the action of using something, and "using" is used when talking about the state of being used. In this sentence, the subject is "people," so the verb should be "use."

This is a common error, as "on" is used when talking about the state of being affected, and "over" is used when talking about the action of affecting.
Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.

Prediction:

The definite article "the" is used to indicate that something belongs to a group of people in general.

Error_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .
Correct_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers from making more effort to do research and design , and they have little motivation to work hard .
Prediction: 
1. The phrasal verb "discourage" means to make someone less likely to do something. In this sentence, the object of the verb is "engineers," so the verb form "discourage" is used. The preposition "to" is used to indicate the direction of the action, so it is used with the infinitive verb "make." The verb "make" is used with the preposition "from" to indicate the source of the action.
2. The conjunction "and" is used to link two clauses or phrases. The phrase "they will have little motivation to work hard" is a clause that is linked to the phrase "engineers from making more effort to do research and design." The conjunction "and" is used to link the two clauses.
3. The modal verb "will" is used to express a future action. In this sentence, the action of "having little motivation to work hard" is a future action, so the modal verb "will" is used.
Erroneous sentence: This is because people are more likely to be addicted to the internet and social media , and they are not able to communicate with others in real life .
Correct sentence: This is because people are more likely to be addicted to the internet and social media , and they are not able to communicate with others in real life .
Explanations:
1. The phrase "in real life" is a collocation. It is used to refer to the real world, as opposed to the virtual world of the internet. The preposition "in" is used to indicate the location of the action.
Erroneous sentence: This is because people are more likely to be addicted to the internet and social media , and they are not able to communicate with others in real life .

cleaned: 1. The phrasal verb "discourage" means to make someone less likely to do something. In this sentence, the object of the verb is "engineers," so the verb form "discourage" is used. The preposition "to" is used to indicate the direction of the action, so it is used with the infinitive verb "make." The verb "make" is used with the preposition "from" to indicate the source of the action.
2. The conjunction "and" is used to link two clauses or phrases. The phrase "they will have little motivation to work hard" is a clause that is linked to the phrase "engineers from making more effort to do research and design." The conjunction "and" is used to link the two clauses.
3. The modal verb "will" is used to express a future action. In this sentence, the action of "having little motivation to work hard" is a future action, so the modal verb "will" is used.
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."




Error_sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other 's permission , this should not be placed or implanted to anyone .
Correct_sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without permission , this technology should not be placed or implanted in anyone .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "other 's" is not commonly used in English. It is more common to say "of other people" or "of others."
2. The phrase "this should not be placed or implanted to anyone" is not grammatically correct. The phrase "this technology" is a noun phrase, and the verb "to be" is used to link it to the noun phrase "placed or implanted."
3. The phrase "to anyone" is not commonly used in English. It is more common to say "in anyone" or "in anyone's body."
Erroneous sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than five percent of the population in the China .
Correct sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than five percent of the population in China .
Errors:
1. Error: lesser, Correction: less
2. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.
Erroneous sentence: Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .
Correct sentence: Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or afraid of .
Errors:

Explanations:

Erroneous sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than five percent of the population in the China .
Correct sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than five percent of the population in China .
Errors:
1. Error:
cleaned: 1. The phrase "other 's" is not commonly used in English. It is more common to say "of other people" or "of others."
2. The phrase "this should not be placed or implanted to anyone" is not grammatically correct. The phrase "this technology" is a noun phrase, and the verb "to be" is used to link it to the noun phrase "placed or implanted."
3. The phrase "to anyone" is not commonly used in English. It is more common to say "in anyone" or "in anyone's body."
Label: 1. As "permission" is something granted by another person, this is already taken for granted without needing to explicitly say "other's". 
2. You should explicitly state "technology" for clarity.
3. An implant goes inside the body, so you need to use "in" accordingly.




Error_sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .
Correct_sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one year ago,when I just arrived singapore .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "one year ago" means one year before the present, so the plural "years" is incorrect. The singular "year" is used to refer to one year, and the plural "years" is used to refer to multiple years.

The definite article "the" is used to refer to a specific country, but the phrase "countries which are much larger than Singapore" refers to multiple countries, so the definite article should be omitted.

3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."

5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.

Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.

Error_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
Correct_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
Prediction: 
1. The modal verb "shall" is used to express obligation or necessity, while the modal verb "should" is used to express a suggestion or a moral obligation. The phrase "should not be easily available" is a suggestion, so "shall" should be changed to "should."
2. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the purpose of something, while the preposition "to" is used to indicate the direction of something. The phrase "easily available to the public" means that the RFID technology is available to the public, so "for" should be changed to "to."
3. The conjunction "and" is used to join two things, while the conjunction "or" is used to join two or more alternatives. The phrase "easily available to the public or taken for granted" means that the RFID technology is either available to the public or taken for granted, so "and" should be changed to "or."

Correct sentence: I believe that the government should take a more active role in regulating the use of social media and the internet , as it is a powerful tool that can be used for both good and bad purposes .

cleaned: 1. The modal verb "shall" is used to express obligation or necessity, while the modal verb "should" is used to express a suggestion or a moral obligation. The phrase "should not be easily available" is a suggestion, so "shall" should be changed to "should."
2. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the purpose of something, while the preposition "to" is used to indicate the direction of something. The phrase "easily available to the public" means that the RFID technology is available to the public, so "for" should be changed to "to."
3. The conjunction "and" is used to join two things, while the conjunction "or" is used to join two or more alternatives. The phrase "easily available to the public or taken for granted" means that the RFID technology is either available to the public or taken for granted, so "and" should be changed to "or."
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.




Error_sentence: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Correct_sentence: In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees to spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Prediction: 
1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "In corporate world" means that this is the only possible world that you are talking about, so you should use "the".
2. The plural "networks" is used to refer to multiple social media networks.
3. The verb "spend" is used with the preposition "on" to indicate what the money is spent on. The preposition "on" is used to indicate the object of the action, so you should use "on" to indicate that the employees are spending their time on their personal leisure.

Correct sentence: In conclusion , I think that it is better for the relatives to know the genetic risk , because it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Explanations:
1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "As the result" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a result", which implies that the outcome is one of several.
3. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many.

cleaned: 1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "In corporate world" means that this is the only possible world that you are talking about, so you should use "the".
2. The plural "networks" is used to refer to multiple social media networks.
3. The verb "spend" is used with the preposition "on" to indicate what the money is spent on. The preposition "on" is used to indicate the object of the action, so you should use "on" to indicate that the employees are spending their time on their personal leisure.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."




Error_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .
Correct_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used on the social media sites .
Prediction: 
1. The preposition "of" is used to indicate the relationship between two nouns, with the first noun being the object of the preposition and the second noun being the object of the preposition. In this sentence, "writing skills" is the object of the preposition and "the more" is the object of the preposition. The preposition "of" is used to indicate that the reduction of writing skills is a result of the more time spent on social media sites.
2. The phrase "social media sites" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the preposition "on" to indicate the state of connection, as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."

Erroneous sentence: The more time spent on the social media sites , the more the writing skills will be reduced .

cleaned: 1. The preposition "of" is used to indicate the relationship between two nouns, with the first noun being the object of the preposition and the second noun being the object of the preposition. In this sentence, "writing skills" is the object of the preposition and "the more" is the object of the preposition.

2. The phrase "social media sites" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the preposition "on" to indicate the state of connection, as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Error_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Correct_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "despite of" is not used in English. The preposition "of" is used to indicate the source or cause of something, but it cannot be used to indicate the opposite of something. The correct expression is "despite", which is used to indicate the opposite of something.
Erroneous sentence: However , there are also some disadvantages of using social media sites .

2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."

cleaned: 1. The conjunction "but" is used to contrast two things. The phrase "one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook" means that the person is neglecting people in real life but only communicating with friends on Facebook. This is not the intended meaning. The intended meaning is that the person is neglecting people in real life and only communicating with friends on Facebook. Therefore, the conjunction "but" should be changed to "and."

With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.

cleaned: 1. The definite article "the" is used to refer to specific things, but the phrase "in the past decades" is talking about a period of time, so it should be removed.
2. The present tense "are" refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often, while the past tense "were" refers to actions or states that were completed in the past. The past tense "were" should be used instead.
3. The present tense "connect" refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often, while the past tense "connected" refers to actions or states that were completed in the past. The past tense "connected" should be used instead.
4. The present tense "live" refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often, while the past tense "lived" refers to actions or states that were completed in the past. The past tense "lived" should be used instead.
Label: 1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."

Correct_sentence: And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering genes is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
Prediction: 
1. The plural "genes" is used to refer to all or any genes, while the singular "gene" is used to refer to one specific gene. The subject "you" is singular, so the verb "choose" is used to refer to one person, so the noun "babies" is used to refer to multiple babies. Therefore, the plural "genes" should be used to refer to all or any genes.

Therefore, the plural "genes" should be used to refer to all or any genes.
Label: 1. The technology to alter genetic material could be applied not just to a single gene but any and all genes. For that reason, it's correct to use the plural "genes" rather than the singular "gene."

2. The plural "contacts" refers to multiple instances of contact, while the singular "contact" refers to one instance of contact. The sentence is talking about the importance of face-to-face human contact in general, so the singular "contact" should be used.

2. The plural "contacts" refers to multiple instances of contact, while the singular "contact" refers to one instance of contact. The sentence is talking about the importance of face-to-face human contact in general, so the singular "contact" should be used.
Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.

Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .

1. The plural "researches" is used to refer to multiple individual research projects, but the singular "research" is used to refer to the collective results of multiple research projects.
2. The verb "show" is used when the subject is a person, and the verb "shows" is used when the subject is a thing. The subject "research" is a thing, so the verb should be "shows".

To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.

Error_sentence: People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
Correct_sentence: People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
Prediction: 
1. The plural "lengths" is used because the sentence is referring to the lengths that people go to in order to make their words as short as possible.
2. The adjective "short" is used to modify the noun "words" and therefore should be used in its adjective form, "short." The adverb "shorter" is used to modify verbs and adjectives, and therefore should not be used here.

cleaned: 1. The plural "lengths" is used because the sentence is referring to the lengths that people go to in order to make their words as short as possible.
2. The adjective "short" is used to modify the noun "words" and therefore should be used in its adjective form, "short." The adverb "shorter" is used to modify verbs and adjectives, and therefore should not be used here.
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".

Correct_sentence: Serendipity is usually defined as the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery , and it often results in the invention of a new technology .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "a discovery under an accidental case" is not a commonly used phrase, and it is unclear what it means. The intended meaning is that serendipity is the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery.
2. The phrase "and it often results the invention of a new technology" is not grammatically correct. The preposition "in" should be used to indicate the result of the discovery.

2. The phrase "and it often results the invention of a new technology" is not grammatically correct. The preposition "in" should be used to indicate the result of the discovery.
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.

5. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "did" implies that the phone is no longer involved in people's work, so it should be the present tense "do" instead.

Correct_sentence: However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "with the existence of" is used to indicate that something exists, but it is not used to indicate that something exists to a certain extent. It is common to say "with the existence of" when referring to a specific thing, but when referring to a general concept, it is common to say "the existence of."
2. The subject is "the existence of social media sites," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "has" for subject-verb agreement.:

1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."
2. The phrase "with the existence of" is used to indicate that something exists, but it is not used to indicate that something exists to a certain extent. It is common to say "with the existence of" when referring to a specific thing, but when referring to a general concept, it is common to say "the existence of."

2. The subject is "the existence of social media sites," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "has" for subject-verb agreement.:
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".

1. The preposition "to" is used to indicate the direction of an action, but here the action is not being directed anywhere, so it should be changed to the preposition "of."
2. The verb "carry" is used to indicate the action of supporting or holding something. The noun "carrying" is the gerund form of the verb "carry," and it means the action of carrying. The gerund form is used to indicate an action that is ongoing or continuous, so it should be changed to "carrying."

2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.

Prediction: 
1. This sentence is talking about people who are on social media, so the preposition "in" should be changed to "on".
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.

2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.
3. The plural "images" is used to refer to multiple images.
4. The preposition "in" is used to indicate location, but social media is not a location, so it should be changed to "on".
5. The verb "do" is used to indicate that someone is performing an action, but the subject here is the third person singular "he or she", so the verb form should be "does not have".

3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.

Correct_sentence: Personally I am studying oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friends .
Prediction: 
1. The present continuous is used to describe actions that are currently ongoing. The present tense "study" refers to the action of studying, but the present continuous "studying" refers to the action of currently studying.
2. The phrase "overseas" refers to countries outside of the country in which the speaker is currently located. The preposition "in" is used to indicate location, so it is used to indicate that the speaker is studying in a country outside of their home country.

Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.

Correct_sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to .
Prediction: 
1. The sentence is discussing the engineering design process in general, so it should be capitalised.
2. The phrase "fused by" is not commonly used. It is more common to say "a process fused by" or "a process that is fused by."
3. The phrase "in the aid of" is not commonly used. It is more common to say "in the aid of" or "in order to."
4. The phrase "desired deeds" is not commonly used. It is more common to say "desired deeds" or "desired outcomes."

cleaned: 1. The sentence is discussing the engineering design process in general, so it should be capitalised.
2. The phrase "fused by" is not commonly used. It is more common to say "a process fused by" or "a process that is fused by."
3. The phrase "in the aid of" is not commonly used. It is more common to say "in the aid of" or "in order to."
4. The phrase "desired deeds" is not commonly used. It is more common to say "desired deeds" or "desired outcomes."
Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."

Correct_sentence: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Prediction: 
1. The preposition "to" is used to indicate direction, while the preposition "of" is used to indicate origin. The phrase "give rise to" means to cause something to happen, so it should be "of."
2. The verb "give" is used with the third person singular pronoun "it," so it should be "gives."
Erroneous sentence: The invention of the internet and the smartphones has made our life so much easier and convenient .
Correct sentence: The invention of the internet and smartphones has made our life so much easier and convenient .
Explanations:
1. The plural noun "smartphones" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing smartphones as a general concept, the plural "smartphones" should be used because it references multiple types.

2. The verb "give" is used with the third person singular pronoun "it," so it should be "gives."

Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.

cleaned: 1. The sentence is talking about one specific baby, so use the indefinite article, "an."
2. The sentence is talking about the end of the marriage, so use the definite article, "the."
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".




Error_sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .
Correct_sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation , particularly small children who are studying in nursery .
Prediction: 
1. The comma is used to separate clauses or phrases. The phrase "particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery" is a non-restrictive clause, which means it adds extra information to the sentence but is not necessary for the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, it should be separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma.
2. The phrase "in particularly for" is a redundancy. The word "particularly" means "especially" and is used to emphasize something. The phrase "in particularly" is not commonly used and is not necessary to convey the meaning of the sentence.
3. The concept of "small children" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific group of children instead of the general concept of small children.

Prediction: 
1. A comma is used to separate clauses or phrases, and the phrase "which are defining the problem, gathering pertinent information, generating possible solutions, analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it" is a non-restrictive clause, which means it is not essential to the meaning of the sentence.

Label: 1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed.

Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.

Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner.

Correct_sentence: This could lead to psychological implications and thus cause many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
Prediction: 
1. The verb "cause" is used to refer to the action of making something happen, while the verb "causing" is used to refer to the action of making something happen in the present.

1. Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".
2. The phrase "face to face" is a common phrase, but it is not used in English. It is common to say "face-to-face", with a hyphen. This is because the phrase "face to face" is a compound noun, and the hyphen is used to join compound nouns.

cleaned: 1. The definite article "the" is used to refer to a specific thing. The phrase "a burden" means any burden, so it should be changed to the indefinite article "a".
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."

cleaned: 1. Newspapers are printed on paper, so you need to use "in" to indicate that the story was in the newspaper.
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".

In this sentence, the engineer is deciding whether to use a particular method, and if they agree with the international laws, then they will use it. Therefore, the correct expression is "agree to".
Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.

Erroneous sentence: The more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .
Correct sentence: The more the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used on the social media sites .
Errors:
1. Error: of, Correction:  
2. Error: in, Correction: on
Explanations:
1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media sites" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 
Erroneous sentence: There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Correct sentence: There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .

cleaned: 1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society, instead of the concept in general.
Label: 1. As "society" is something general and uncountable, it does not need an article, so remove "the".




Error_sentence: When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
Correct_sentence: When people around us know that we got a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , whether caring for us too much or keeping away from us .
Prediction: 
1. The definite article "a" is used to refer to one of many things, so it implies that there are many diseases and that people may have different attitudes toward different diseases.
2. The word "altitudes" means the height of a place above sea level, and it is not used to refer to people's attitudes. The word "attitudes" means people's feelings or opinions, and it is used to refer to people's feelings or opinions.
3. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the object of an action. The phrase "caring for us" means that people will care about us, and the phrase "keeping away from us" means that people will stay away from us. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the object of an action, so it is used to indicate what people will do.

cleaned: 1. The definite article "a" is used to refer to one of many things, so it implies that there are many diseases and that people may have different attitudes toward different diseases.
2. The word "altitudes" means the height of a place above sea level, and it is not used to refer to people's attitudes. The word "attitudes" means people's feelings or opinions, and it is used to refer to people's feelings or opinions.
3. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the object of an action. The phrase "caring for us" means that people will care about us, and the phrase "keeping away from us" means that people will stay away from us. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the object of an action, so it is used to indicate what people will do.
Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

Correct_sentence: Therefore , considering people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Prediction: 
1. The concept of "people's privacy" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the people's privacy," meaning the privacy of one specific person, instead of people's privacy in general.

Correct sentence: The more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .

Explanations:
1. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
2. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on. explanation

Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: are, Correction: were
3. Error: connect, Correction: connected
4. Error: live, Correction: lived
Explanations:
1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader.

2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead

Label: 1. The sentence is talking about people in general, so it does not need an article.

Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.

Correct_sentence: It is also important to use better material that can support buildings during any natural disasters like earthquakes .
Prediction:

2. Unnecessary article. You are talking about any material, so use the indefinite article, "a".
3. Unnecessary article. You are talking about any material, so use the indefinite article, "a".
4. Incorrect word choice. "Despite" means in spite of, so you should use "during".
5. Incorrect word choice. You are talking about any natural disaster, so use the plural, "disasters".

3. Unnecessary article. You are talking about any material, so use the indefinite article, "a".
4. Incorrect word choice. "Despite" means in spite of, so you should use "during".
5. Incorrect word choice. You are talking about any natural disaster, so use the plural, "disasters".
Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.
