1. the singular "human resource" should be pluralized to "human resources" to refer to the people involved in the process.
2. "qualified" is redundant in this context as creative human resources implies that they are qualified for the task at hand.
3. since the sentence is discussing human resources in general, the use of the definite article "the" is not necessary.

1. "on the other side" is incorrect. the correct phrase is "on the other hand," which is commonly used to introduce a different perspective or point.
2. "a person who want" is incorrect. the subject "a person" is singular, so the verb should also be singular, which is "wants."
3. in this context, "genetic testing" is a non-count noun, so it should not be pluralized.

1. the word "disadvantage" is being pluralized when it should be singular since "one of the" indicates singularity. 
2. "concern" should be replaced with "concerned" to form a correct sentence structure. 
3. the word "loss" should be used instead of "loss," as in this context it is referring to the act of losing interest rather than the result of losing interest.

1. "shall" is considered more formal and is used to indicate future action, such as in contracts or legal documents. in this context, "should" is more appropriate to convey a recommendation or preference.
2. the preposition "for" is not required after the word "abuse." the sentence flows more smoothly without its inclusion.

1. the phrase "with cash reimbursement" implies that the companies are leaking the information in exchange for cash reimbursement. the preposition "for" should be used to show the purpose of leaking the information.

1. the word "research" should be used in the singular form when referring to a body of work or a study.
2. incorrect plural form. the correct plural form of "research" is "research studies" or "pieces of research."
1. the word "evidences" should be singular "evidence" since it is being used in a general sense. 
2. use "for" instead of "of" before "the halt of the work" to show the reason for stopping the work. 
3. the phrase "higher level of authorities" can be simplified to "higher level authorities" for smoother flow.
1. the singular form of "police" is "police" and does not take the plural "-s" ending in this context.
1. the subject of the sentence is "user," which is singular, so the verb "come" should be in the singular form, "comes."
2. the phrase "when he/she accidentally comes into contact with the device" indicates a possibility or condition that may occur, which is why "might" is used to indicate the uncertainty of the event happening.
1. incorrect preposition usage. when someone depends on someone else, you rely "on" that person, not just "rely" followed by the person.
1. the correct phrase is "to put it in a nutshell" not "to put it in the nutshell." it is an idiom used to indicate a brief summary or conclusion.
2. if you mention "the genetic testing result," it means you are referring to a specific result, so add the definite article "the" before "genetic testing result".
1. the verb "discuss" already implies that the topic will be talked about or considered, so the addition of "about" is redundant.
2. in this context, "daily life" refers to the lives of individuals in general, so it should be pluralized to match the plurality of "advantages and disadvantages."
1. the verb "connect" should agree with the subject "internet," which is singular, so it should be in the singular form "connects."
2. the possessive form "people's" is correctly used to indicate that the time saved belongs to people.
1. the phrase "social media" is a collective term for online platforms where users can interact, so it should not have an article.
1. the term "add-on" should be pluralized as "add-ons" to be grammatically correct.
1. incorrect word order. the word "however" should be used at the beginning of the sentence to indicate a contrast or transition. 
2. wrong preposition usage. the correct preposition to use in this context is "on" instead of "over" to show that something is being used against someone or for control.
1. the phrase "have their right" is grammatically incorrect because the noun "right" is not typically possessive. to show that the parents have a right, the possessive pronoun "their" should be removed to make "the right."
2. the word "healthiness" is commonly used to describe the general state of being healthy, but in this context, it doesn't fit well. the more commonly used term in this context is "health status" or simply "health."
1. "belive" should be corrected to "believe."
2. the use of "still" at the end of the sentence is redundant and unnecessary.
1. the verb "discourage" is typically followed by the preposition "from" when indicating the cause of a lack of motivation or deterrence. the correct preposition in this context is "from."
2. the phrase "engineers to make more effort" should be corrected to "engineers from making more effort." this change makes the sentence more grammatically correct and clear in its intended meaning.
3. the phrase "little motivation to work hard" is more concise and clear than "little motivation to work hard." the wording is more direct and easier to understand for the reader.
1. "to anyone" should be replaced with "in anyone" to correctly convey the idea that the technology should not be inserted into someone's body.
2. "other's" should be replaced with "permission" to indicate that the action of placing or implanting technology requires the individual's consent.
1. the word "years" should be singular because it is preceded by the numeral "one."
1. the verb "thought" should be replaced with "think" to match the tense of the rest of the sentence.
2. the word "obligated" should be followed by "to" to indicate what the person is obligated to do.
1. in this sentence, "transfer" should be in the past participle form "transferred" to indicate that the action has already taken place. 
2. the correct preposition to use after "transfer" in this context is "to" not "for". 
3. the subject "everything" is singular, so the verb "is" is correct for subject-verb agreement.
1. the word "shwing" is a misspelling. the correct spelling is "showing."
2. the word "experiences" should be in the plural form to match the plural noun "pictures."
1. the word "more" is used to compare two items, but in this case, there are only two options, so the comparative form "easier" is sufficient.
2. the phrase "more easier" is redundant as it repeats the idea of "more" twice. just using "easier" is enough to make the comparison.
1. the noun phrase "the internet" commonly takes the definite article "the" because it is a specific thing that most people know about.
2. the subject "the internet" is singular, so the verb should also be singular. "were" is the past plural form of "to be," so it should be changed to "was."
1. the preposition "to" is unnecessary in this sentence. the correct sentence should be "it is weird that people sit around the table but all face their phones and do not talk with each other."
1. "elements" is plural, while "element" should be singular to match the verb "is." use "element" to ensure subject-verb agreement.
1. "happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". the subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. the definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. the author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. the be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. the subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "find back" is not a common phrase.
1. the word "challenges" should be singular to agree with "another" and maintain subject-verb agreement.
2. the lack of agreement between "challenges" and "procedures" results in a grammar error. the correct version makes sure that there is an agreement between the subject and the complement in the sentence.
1. the subject "privacy issue" is singular, so the verb "has" should be pluralized to "have" to match the subject.
2. the phrase "at the first place" is incorrect. the correct phrase is "in the first place," which means from the beginning.
1. incorrect subject-verb agreement. the subject "both of his parents" is plural, so the verb should be "have" instead of "has."
2. incorrect word choice. it should be "at high risk" instead of "under high risk."
3. incorrect spelling. the correct spelling is "running."
4. incorrect verb form. "know" should be "knows" to agree with the singular subject "he."
5. incorrect capitalization. "run" should not be capitalized unless at the beginning of a sentence.
1. missing article. "the" should be used before "next generation" to indicate a specific generation.
1. the verb "create" is misspelled as "creat." 
2. the word "some" is unnecessary and can be omitted for a clearer sentence. 
3. the phrase "for people" is more concise than "for the people" since it refers to people in general.
1. "shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern english. "should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. the author believes making rfid available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.
2. the phrase "taken for granted" is a set phrase that means to not appreciate something or someone just because it is always there. the wrong preposition "and" is used here, which does not connect the two parts of the sentence correctly. changing "and" to "or" provides the correct meaning.
1. "social media network" should be pluralized to "social media networks" to refer to the various platforms available.
2. use the gerund form "spending" after the preposition "to" to indicate the purpose of blocking social media networks.
3. the parallel list requires consistency in structure. the incorrect sentence lists two activities: spending office time on personal leisure and concentrating on work. to maintain consistency, the latter activity should be phrased as "concentrating on work" not "concentrating on their work".
1. the structure "the more... the more..." should be used to show the relationship between two factors increasing or decreasing together.
2. "time used on" is the correct preposition to describe the action of using time on social media sites.
1. the phrase "despite of the distance" is incorrect. the correct phrase is "despite the distance," which means "in spite of the distance." "despite" is a preposition, and "of" is not needed to follow it.
1. in this case, the article "the" should be omitted before "social media." "social media" is a general concept, so it does not require the definite article "the" before it.
1. the word "moral" should be pluralized to "morals" to refer to a set of principles or values.
2. the phrase "personal moral" should be changed to "personal morals" to indicate individual beliefs or values, rather than a singular moral standard.
1. in the incorrect sentence, the word "wishes" is missing the article "a" before it. when talking about sending wishes for a special occasion, it should be "send a birthday wish" or "send birthday wishes" if referring to multiple wishes.
2. the word "tend" should be followed by the base form of the verb, so it should be "tend to send" instead of "tend send". 
3. the apostrophe should not be used in "someone's" because it is used to indicate possession, while in this sentence it is used to describe the word "someone".
1. the plural form "thoughts" should be used instead of "thought" to match the plural form of "personalities." 
2. the singular form "personality" should be used instead of "personalities" to maintain subject-verb agreement.
1. the subject of the sentence is "social media," which is plural, so the verb should be pluralized to "make."
2. the possessive form of "people" is "people's," not "people 's."
3. the noun following "provide" should be pluralized to match the subject "social media."
1. use "by only" instead of "with only" to show the method of truly understanding a person is through stalking their facebook page.
2. use "by stalking" to show the action of stalking the facebook page.
3. use "his or her" instead of "his/her" for better readability and formality.
1. the phrase "what the best is" is incorrect. it should be "what is best" or "what the best choice is".
2. the phrase "they have be informed" is incorrect. it should be "they have been informed". use the past participle "been" after "have".
1. the plural form "relationships" is needed as it refers to more than one relationship.
2. extra commas before "as well as" create a punctuation error. remove the comma before "as well as" to correct the sentence.
1. the word "concurently" is incorrect. the correct word is "concurrently," which means at the same time or simultaneously.
2. the phrase "has knowledge about" is more concise and grammatically correct compared to "has a knowledge about."
1. incorrect spelling. the correct spelling is "obviously".
1. the subject "social media" is a singular noun, so the correct verb form should be "does" instead of "do."
2. when referring to a category or concept like "relationships," the concept should be singular in english, but when referring to the individual relationships within the category, it can be plural.
1. "shy" is not followed by "for" in this context. the correct preposition to use after "shy" is "about". 

2. "be afraid of" is a fixed phrase that does not require the preposition "of" after "afraid".
1. the conjunction "but" is used to show contrast or exception, while "and" is used to show an additional action or thought. in this sentence, the author is talking about neglecting people in physical surroundings and only communicating with friends on facebook as two separate actions, so the correct conjunction to use is "and" to connect these two ideas.
1. "effective" is an adjective that describes a singular noun, so it should be "an effective policy" instead of "effective policy."
2. the phrase "even faster" is comparative, indicating that china's pace will grow at a quicker rate. it compares the speed to a previous level of speed, not to another party's speed. therefore, "even faster" should be used instead of "even more faster."
1. the concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. it takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. this sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "in past decades." the present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. this sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "in past decades." the present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. this sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "in past decades." it's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."
1. "gene" in this context refers to the genetic material of an individual, so when referring to specific genes that are being altered, "genes" should be used in the plural form. this is because each individual possesses multiple genes, and altering any one of those genes can have various effects.
2. incorrect verb form. in this context, "has been developed so advanced" implies that the technology has reached a high level of advancement. the correct form should be "has been developed so advanced" to maintain subject-verb agreement and communicate the intended meaning effectively.
1. "genetic field" is a singular concept, so the singular article "the" should be used before it instead of "in the."
2. double repetition. the phrase "further and further" is redundant and can be simplified to simply "further" to convey the same meaning.
1. the article "the" before "face-to-face human contacts" is unnecessary. it should be "face-to-face human contact" as they refer to the same concept.
2. spelling error: "decreased" is misspelled as "decresed."
1. "researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "he/she researches social media use." based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralized as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research."
2. incorrect conjugation. "research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.
1. the preposition "of" indicates possession or belonging. in this context, "for" should be used to indicate that writing is a necessary skill for individuals who express their own feelings and opinions.
1. the preposition "against" is needed after "discriminate" to show the target of the discrimination. 

erroneous sentence: the government has put in place strict regulations in an effort to minimize air pollution , however , it is still a prevalent issue in many cities.
correct sentence: the government has put in place strict regulations in an effort to minimize air pollution ; however , it is still a prevalent issue in many cities.
explanations:
1. a semicolon should be used before the conjunctive adverb "however" when connecting two independent clauses.
1. the phrase "scientific research result" is not correct. the correct phrase should be "scientific research results" because "results" is a countable noun, and in this context, it refers to the outcomes of the scientific research, which are multiple and varied. 
2. there is a punctuation error. the comma in the incorrect sentence should be a period, making the two parts of the sentence separate independent clauses. the correct sentence structure is "and after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life. products such as rfid tracking systems have become real."
1. subject-verb agreement: the subject "expressing themselves appropriately" is singular, so the verb should be "becomes" to match.
1. the word "internet" is a proper noun and should be capitalized.
2. the preposition "to" is used to show direction or movement towards a specific point or location. in this case, the networking has moved from real life to the internet, so "to" is the appropriate preposition to use.
1. the phrase "each other" refers to two people or things, while "each others" is incorrect. 
2. in this context, "role" is more appropriate than "aspect" because it conveys the idea of importance or significance within a situation or topic.
1. "the society" refers to a specific society, while "society" in this context refers to society in general. since the sentence is discussing social media in a general context, the definite article "the" is not needed before "society".
1. missing punctuation. the use of an apostrophe followed by "s" ('s) indicates possession, so it should be used to show that the view belongs to forest.
1. the phrase "go to great lengths" is a collocation, so it should not be separated by "to make their words as." to make their words short is the action being described, so the collocation should be used in its entirety.
2. the comparative adjective "shorter" can be simplified to the adjective "short," making the comparison clear and concise.
1. typographical error: "seconly" should be corrected to "secondly" to indicate the order of the point being made.
2. typographical error: "dignosis" should be corrected to "diagnosis" which refers to the identification of a disease or condition by examination of the symptoms.
3. typographical error: it's worth mentioning "relatives" is plural, and in this sentence, it refers to more than one person, so "can" is the correct auxiliary verb, instead of "can".
1. "under an accidental case" is not idiomatic in english. it should be "under accidental circumstances" or simply "accidentally."
2. "results" is a transitive verb, so it needs a direct object. in this case, it should be "results in the invention of a new technology" to make the sentence grammatically correct.
1. the phrase "the earlier, the better" is a comparison structure that requires the use of "the" before both "earlier" and "better" for parallelism.
2. the word "habit" should be followed by the verb "develop" instead of "arise" to clarify the action that will be taken.
the phrase "telling the genetic testing result" is awkward and unclear. it seems like the correct sentence should be rephrased for clarity and coherence.
1. the word "supports" should be singular "support" to match the singular subject "more support."
2. "of such junction" should be "at such a junction" to be grammatically correct. 
3. the phrase "whether should him/her to inform the relatives" is awkward and unclear. it should be revised to "whether he/she should inform the relatives."
1. the phrase "according to research" is a set expression and does not require an article before "research".
2. "the users" is unnecessary as it is implied in the context. use "users" instead.
3. the proper name of the social media platform is "facebook", so "the" should be removed before it.
1. the expression "almost the equally" is incorrect. the correct phrase should be "almost equally" to show that the risk is nearly the same for all family members.
2. the preposition "of" should be used after "risk" to show the relationship between the risk and having the genetic disorder.
1. the subject "phone" is singular, so the verb should agree with it. with "phone" being singular, it should be "does" instead of "did."
2. when referring to general types of devices in a list, plural forms of the words should be used, such as "personal computers," "laptops," and "tablets."
3. the phrase "the internet" refers to the global system of interconnected computer networks, which is a specific entity and requires the definite article "the" before "internet."
1. the comma after "that" is unnecessary. it creates a pause in the sentence that disrupts the flow and doesn't serve a grammatical purpose.
2. when using a copular verb like "is," the subject complement should match the number of the subject. since "benefits" is plural, the verb should be "are" instead of "is."
3. the correct spelling of "reflected" is with a "c" instead of a "l."
1. the correct preposition to use after the verb "agree" in this context is "with," not "on."
2. the phrase "this argument" should be replaced with "this statement" because the sentence is referring to a specific statement, not a general argument.
1. use of the definite article "the" before "existence" is necessary to indicate that you are talking about a specific existence, in this case, of social media sites.
2. the subject "existence" is singular, so the verb "has" should be used for subject-verb agreement.
1. "usage" and "reliance" are both followed by the preposition "on", not "of". 
2. "more advance" should be corrected to "more advanced" for proper grammar.
1. the preposition "with" is used to indicate the relationship between "social media" and "people" when referring to what is being provided.
1. "interpersonal skills" is a compound noun, so it should be treated as a singular entity and not pluralised.
1. missing article. in english, when a singular countable noun is introduced for the first time, it is preceded by an indefinite article to indicate that it is one of many possible things. in this case, "a need" is used to refer to discussing the advantages and disadvantages of social media as one of many possible needs.
1. missing article. "time" is a countable noun and requires an article before it to indicate a specific time.
2. using the definite article "the" before "time" indicates that it is a specific time, in this case, the time spent away from the computer screen or mobile phone.
3. the incorrect use of the preposition "between." the correct preposition in this context is "and" rather than "between," as it is used to contrast two items, in this case, "interaction between human and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone."
1. when comparing quantities or numbers, the correct term to use is "less" when referring to a smaller amount and "fewer" when referring to a smaller number of discrete items. in this case, since we are comparing percentages of a population, "less" should be used instead of "lesser."
1. the superlative "latest" should be used to refer to the most recent news and updates.
2. missing "the" before "latest" for correct english grammar.
1. the word "indicates" is incorrect in this sentence, as it should be in the present form to match the rest of the sentence. the correct word should be "indicate".
2. the phrase "certain disease" should be changed to "a certain disease" or "certain diseases" to indicate that the patients have a high chance of carrying a specific disease or multiple diseases.
1. the word "emotional" is the correct adjective to describe thoughts related to emotions, not "emotional".
1. the phrase "contact environment" should be preceded by the indefinite article "a" as "a more convenient contact environment" because it's referring to one in a non-specific way.
2. the verb "improve" should be in the present tense to match the verb "provides." the correct form is "improves."
1. incorrect preposition. when discussing topics, use "discuss" followed by "both", not "about".
2. "down sides" is not the correct phrase. the correct term is "downsides", which is typically used as one word to refer to disadvantages or negative aspects.
1. incorrect preposition. the correct preposition to use is "in," not "on," when talking about invading privacy.
2. incorrect article. "human privacy" is a general concept and does not require the article "the." 
3. unnecessary comma. remove the comma after "privacy" as it is not needed in this sentence structure.
1. the word "gene" should be pluralized to "genes" to refer to multiple units of genetic information rather than one.
2. the phrase "on the contrary" should be used to show opposition between two ideas or situations.
1. "people" is a plural noun, so the corresponding verb should be in the plural form. the correct form is "say" instead of "says".
1. the past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. the past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.
1. "skill" should be pluralized to match the plural noun "skills".
2. incorrect subject-verb agreement. use the plural form "are" to match the plural noun "skills".
1. "in the social media" should be changed to "on social media" as "on" is used to indicate the platform where people are present.
2. the verb "do" should be changed to "do not" to maintain parallelism with "may not have jobs."
1. the use of "is" implies present tense, suggesting that the technology is still not advanced. however, the context indicates that this was the case in the past, so "was" should be used to convey the correct tense.
the error in this sentence is that it includes the definite article "the" before "society." in this context, "society" is a general concept, and the definite article is not needed. it should simply be "for society" to refer to society in general, rather than a specific society.
1. incorrect tense. the correct form is "studying" instead of "study".
2. incorrect preposition. the correct preposition is "abroad" instead of "oversea".
3. use of singular form. the correct form is "friends" instead of "friend" to indicate multiple friends.
1. "human" is a collective noun referring to the entire species, so it should be used in the plural form "humans" to show that it encompasses all individuals within the species.
1. incorrect pronoun. the possessive pronoun "her" should be replaced by the possessive pronoun "his" to match the possessive noun "daughter".
2. incorrect article. the correct phrase is "the internet" since it refers to a specific network.
1. incorrect preposition. the correct phrase is "seeking out attention" meaning to actively look for or pursue attention.
2. unnecessary word. the word "for" is not needed in this context.
1. the sentence is talking about a general fact or statement, so "claimed" should be changed to "claim" to match the present tense of the sentence.
1. subject-verb agreement error. the subject "advantages" is plural, so the verb should also be plural "come" instead of "comes."
2. incorrect use of plural "mobile application." the correct term is "mobile applications" when referring to multiple applications.
1. incorrect verb form. the correct form of the verb is "announce".
2. incorrect noun form. the correct noun form is "checks" rather than "check" in this context because it is referring to multiple instances of doing medical checks.
3. incorrect verb form. the correct form of the verb is "creates".
1. the phrase "spend too much time on internet" is missing the preposition "the" before "internet." the correct phrase should be "spend too much time on the internet."
2. the verb form "spend" should be changed to "spending" to make it a gerund form. this is because the phrase "spending too much time on the internet" is functioning as the subject of the sentence.
1. the phrase "fused by fellow engineers" is not grammatically correct. it should be "by fellow engineers."
2. the phrase "on the current on" is repetitive and should be corrected to "on the current."
3. the phrase "to cater to desired deeds" is not clear and can be improved by replacing it with a more specific objective or goal.
1. incorrect use of the verb "get". in this context, the action of putting loved ones in danger is intentional, so the correct verb to use is "put" instead of "get". 
2. redundant phrasing. saying "get their loved ones in danger" is unnecessarily wordy and can be simplified to "put their loved ones in danger".
1. the word "lost" is used as a verb to refer to physically losing something, while "loss" is the correct noun form in this context to refer to the decline or reduction in interpersonal skills.
2. the incorrect sentence uses "lost" but the context of the sentence is talking about the decrease in interpersonal skills, not losing them permanently. therefore, the correct word to use is "loss" to indicate a reduction or decline in skills over time.
1. use "cause of" instead of "cause to", as the gases are the source of global warming, not the action that brings it about.
2. incorrect subject-verb agreement. use the singular verb "gives" to agree with the singular subject "cause".
1. the past participle of the verb "see" is "seen" and not "seen." in this sentence, "seen" would be used as part of the verb "have seen" in a different structure, but it should be "seen" if it is part of a passive structure.
2. the word "confidential" means private or secret. in this sentence, the disease itself should be kept confidential, not the risk of getting the disease.
1. incorrect article usage. the correct article is "an" before "unhealthy baby" to describe the baby's health condition.
2. "or" should be followed by "the end of their marriage" for parallel structure to match the previous phrase "the death of the baby."
1. incorrect preposition usage. "in particularly" should be changed to "particularly" to indicate a specific situation within a general category.
2. unnecessary repetition. "for the small children" is redundant because nursery students are already implied to be young.
1. when listing items in a series or sequence, use a comma before the coordinating conjunction "and" if there are three or more items in the list.
2. the phrase "basic design processes" is the antecedent of the relative pronoun "which," so they should be directly next to each other for clarity.
1. the term "social media" is already in the plural form, so the word "media" should not be pluralized as "medias." social media is an uncountable noun, referring to platforms for sharing information and connecting with others online.
1. "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. when used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and should not have an "s" at the end.
1. "research" is an uncountable noun in this context and does not require an article.
2. use the plural "users" instead of "the users," as it refers to users in general. 
3. the name of the social media platform is "facebook," and it does not require a definite article.
1. the use of "but" is incorrect in this context because it suggests a contrast between neglecting people surrounding them and communicating with friends on facebook. a more appropriate conjunction would be "and" to show the continuation of neglecting people and only communicating with friends on facebook.
1. "dinners" should be singular to match the verb "having."
2. "their" should be "they are" to indicate action rather than possession.

1. the word "dilemma" is a countable noun, so when referring to multiple ethical conflicts, you need to use the plural form "dilemmas" instead of the singular "dilemma".
1. subject-verb agreement error. "wife" is singular, so the verb should be "gives" instead of "give".
1. the subject "social network site" is plural because it refers to multiple websites, so it should be "sites" instead of "site".

1. the incorrect article "the" is used before the word "burden." "a burden" should be used because it refers to an unspecified or generalized burden that the carrier might not want to be in her family. the definite article "the" is used to refer to one specific burden, which is not the intended meaning in this context.

1. the preposition "for" cannot be used before "another year." it should be "stay another year in the secondary school" to indicate how long the student was asked to stay in the school.
2. the phrase "top 1 student" is awkward. it should be corrected to "top student" as there can only be one top student in a province.

2. this sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
3. this sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.
1. "immediate" is an adjective, while "immediately" is an adverb. in this case, the adverb "immediately" is needed to describe how information is disseminated through social media.

3. incorrect conjugation. use the third person plural "live" to go with "humans".

3. "disorder problem" is redundant. either "disorder" or "problem" can be used alone to convey the same meaning.
1. the subject of the sentence is "family members," which is a plural noun, so the verb "are" should be used instead of "is" to agree in number with the subject.
1. this sentence is not using "thousand" as a specific number, i.e. 1,000, it is using it metaphorically to express a large, unspecified amount. in this case, it should be pluralized as "thousands".

3. this is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralized.
1. "create a better material" implies manufacturing or developing new material, while "use better material" refers to the act of using existing or improved material. in this case, the context suggests the use of better material instead of creating it.
2. "despite" is used to show contrast or to introduce something unexpected. in this context, "during" should be used to indicate the time when the support is needed, which is during natural disasters like earthquakes.
1. the plural form "devices" should be used because the sentence is referring to more than one electronic device.
2. the word "using" should be used instead of "using" because the sentence is about the action of utilizing the auto correction software while using electronic devices, not specifically the act of physical contact with the devices themselves.
3. the verb "realize" should be in the past tense, "realized," to match the past tense of the sentence.
4. the phrase "the importance of writing" refers to the significance of written communication, so it should be used with the definite article "the".
