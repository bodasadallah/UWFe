1. "qualified" is not necessary in this sentence because the focus is on creativity rather than specific qualifications. 
2. "resource" should be pluralized to "resources" to indicate that the lack is affecting multiple aspects of human resources.

1. "side" should be replaced with "hand" to properly contrast with "on the other hand" in the sentence.
2. "want" should be changed to "wants" to match the subject-verb agreement.4.
3. "who want" should be changed to "who wants" to maintain subject-verb agreement.
4. "testing individually" should be changed to "testing individually" to correct the improper use of the phrase.

1. "disadvantage" should be pluralized to "disadvantages" to match the plurality of the subject "one".
2. "concerns" should be changed to "concern" to match the singular form needed with the verb "is".
3. "loss" should be changed to "lose" to correct the verb tense and usage.
4. "of" should be removed before "face-to-face communication" to improve the clarity and correctness of the sentence.

1. "shall" should be replaced with "should" to indicate a recommendation or possibility, rather than a command or obligation.
2. "abuse" should be used as a noun, not as an adjective as in "abusive," to describe the action of mistreating something.
3. "distorted" should be replaced with "distortedly" to convey the idea that the usage itself is distorted, not the technology being used in a distorted manner.

1. "leaks" is used as a verb in the erroneous sentence when it should be used as a noun, "leaks users' information."
2. the preposition "with" is used incorrectly in the erroneous sentence. it should be "for" to show the reason for leaking users' information.

1. "researches" should be "research" because when referring to a study or investigation, "research" is an uncountable noun and does not require a plural form.
2. "frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites" should be "frequency among people who are addicted to social media sites" because "who" should be used to refer to people, not "that."
1. "evidences" is incorrect because "evidence" is already a plural noun and does not need to be pluralized.
2. "of halt of work" is incorrect because "for the halt of the work" is the correct prepositional phrase to use.
3. "authorities" is incorrect because "higher level authorities" should be used to specify a specific group of authorities.
1. error: "polices" should be "police"
   explanation: the word "police" is a plural noun, so it should be used in its singular form "police" in this sentence. 

2. error: "prevent these hoaxes spreading around" should be "prevent these hoaxes from spreading around"
   explanation: the preposition "from" is needed to indicate that the action of preventing is directed towards the hoaxes spreading around.
1. "come" should be corrected to "comes": this is a subject-verb agreement error. the subject "user" is singular, so the verb "comes" should also be singular to match. 
2. missing comma before "he/she": this is a punctuation error. in this case, a comma should be placed before the conjunction "he/she" to separate two independent clauses.
1. error: "rely the parent" should be "rely on the parents"
explanation: the word "rely" should be followed by the preposition "on" to show who or what is being depended on.

2. error: missing the plural "s" in "parents"
explanation: since the correct sentence is referring to more than one parent, the plural form "parents" should be used.
1. error: "to put it in the nutshell" 
   correction: "to put it in a nutshell"
   explanation: the phrase is commonly used as "in a nutshell" to indicate a brief summary or explanation.

2. error: "obligation"
   correction: "obligation"
   explanation: the article "the" is unnecessary before the word "obligation" in this sentence.
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary use of the word "about" after the word "discuss." the correct sentence should simply read "this essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives." the word "about" is not needed in this context and should be removed.
2. another error in the erroneous sentence is the use of the word "life" instead of "lives" at the end of the sentence. since "our" is referring to multiple people, the correct word to use for the possessive form is "lives." so, the corrected sentence should end with "in our daily lives" instead of "in our daily life."
1. error: "connect" should be changed to "connects"
   explanation: the verb "connect" needs to agree with the subject "internet," so it should be changed to "connects" to maintain subject-verb agreement in the present tense.

2. error: missing punctuation after "people's time"
   explanation: a comma should be included after "people's time" to separate two distinct phrases within the sentence.
1. "accidentally done" should be replaced with "accidentally damaged" or "accidentally broken" to convey the intended meaning that the phones were damaged or broken by accident.
2. "get contact with" should be replaced with "get in contact with" to use the correct preposition "in" when talking about making contact with someone.
1. error: "add-on" should be corrected to "add-ons"
   explanation: the term "add-ons" is used to refer to multiple additional features or enhancements, while "add-on" is singular. 

2. error: missing closing parenthesis after "i.e"
   explanation: the correction adds the necessary punctuation to properly close off the abbreviation "i.e." and maintain proper grammar in the sentence.
1. error: "the more people using it over us" 
explanation: the word "using" should be in its base form "use" to make the sentence grammatically correct. 
2. error: "on us" 
explanation: the correct preposition to use in this context is "on us" instead of "over us" to convey the intended meaning.
1. "have their right" should be corrected to "have the right" because the article "the" is needed before "right" to make it specific.
2. "healthiness" should be corrected to "health" because "health" is the correct term to refer to the state of well-being of a person.
1. "belive" should be corrected to "believe" - the correct spelling of the word is "believe."
2. "tell still" should be corrected to "tell" - the word "still" is redundant and unnecessary in this context.
1. incorrect preposition: "discourages engineers to make" should be "discourages engineers from making". the correct preposition to use after "discourages" is "from" followed by the gerund form of the verb.
2. incorrect conjunction: "to do research and design, for they will have little motivation to work hard" should be "and they have little motivation to work hard". the conjunction "for" should be replaced with "and" to properly connect the two clauses.
1. the error in the first part of the sentence is incorrect use of possessive form. the correct form should be "without permission" instead of "without other 's permission".
2. the error in the second part of the sentence is semantic. the word "this" is vague and does not clearly refer to anything specific. the correction replaces "this" with "technology" to clarify what should not be placed or implanted.
1. error: "one years ago" should be "one year ago"
explanation: "years" should be singular since the correct phrase is "one year ago" to indicate a specific period of time.

2. error: "invoving" should be "involving"
explanation: the correct spelling is "involving" to indicate active participation or engagement.
1. "thought" should be "think": the error here is a tense inconsistency. the sentence is discussing a current belief, so the present tense "think" should be used instead of the past tense "thought."

2. "be obligated" should be "be obligated to": the error here is in the structure of the phrase "be obligated to tell." it is missing the preposition "to" after "obligated," which is necessary for proper grammar.
1. error: "transfer" should be "transferred"
explanation: the verb should be in the past tense to match the rest of the sentence which is in the past tense.

2. error: "to" should be "for"
explanation: the preposition "for" is used to indicate the purpose or reason for something, in this case, spying and advertising.
1. error: "shwing" should be "showing"
   explanation: the error is a spelling mistake, as the correct word is "showing".

2. error: "experience" should be "experiences"
   explanation: the error is a grammatical mistake, as "experiences" should be in plural form to match with the plural noun "people".
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the use of the word "more" before the adjective "easier". the word "more" is unnecessary in this context because "easier" is already a comparative form of the adjective "easy". therefore, the correction removes the word "more" to make the sentence grammatically correct and concise.
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the use of "internet" without an article "the." the correct sentence includes the definite article "the," making it "the internet." this error occurred because "internet" is a proper noun and should be treated as a specific entity.

2. the error in the erroneous sentence is the use of the verb "were" after "the internet." the correct sentence uses the verb "was" to agree with the singular subject "the internet." this error occurred because "the internet" is a singular entity, so it should be followed by the singular verb "was."
1. "to" is unnecessary before "their phones" because it is redundant and does not add any meaning to the sentence.
2. "with each other" should be corrected to "with other" because it is more concise and clear in this context.
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the use of the plural form "elements" instead of the singular form "element." in this context, "essential" is describing a single element that is crucial for overcoming challenges, so it should be singular.
2. there should be an article "the" before "essential element" to show that it is specific and not just any essential element.
1. "this is happen" should be corrected to "this happens" - the error is in the verb tense. "happen" is the incorrect form; it should be "happens" to match the present tense of the sentence.
2. "in the country" should be corrected to "in countries" - the error is in pluralization. the sentence is referring to multiple countries, so it should be plural instead of singular.
3. "find the child back" should be corrected to "find the child" - the error is in phrasing. the phrase "find the child back" is not grammatically correct; it should simply be "find the child" without the word "back."
1. error: "challenges" should be singular, "challenge"
   explanation: the word "another" indicates that only one challenge is being referred to, therefore it should be singular.
   
2. error: there is an unnecessary space before the comma after "however"
   explanation: punctuation marks should not have a space before them.
1. error: "privacy issue" should be corrected to "privacy issues"
   explanation: "privacy" is a concept that encompasses various issues, so it should be pluralized to indicate that there are multiple issues related to privacy.

2. error: "at the first place" should be corrected to "in the first place"
   explanation: the correct phrase is "in the first place," which is used to introduce the original or initial point being made.
1. "has" should be changed to "have" to match the subject "both of his parents."
2. "under high risk" should be changed to "at high risk" which is the correct idiom.
3. "runing" should be changed to "running" to correct the spelling mistake.
4. "know" should be changed to "knows" to match the subject "he."
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the phrase "to next generation." the correct phrasing is "to the next generation." the word "the" is necessary to specify which generation is being referred to.

2. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary use of the word "thus." the word "thus" is unnecessary because the sentence already flows logically without it. it is redundant and can be removed to improve the sentence's clarity and conciseness.
1. error: the unnecessary article "the" before "people."
explanation: in this case, "people" is a general plural noun and does not require an article before it.

2. error: "creat" should be corrected to "create."
explanation: the verb "create" should be in its correct form to match the subject "social network."
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the use of "shall" instead of "should". "shall" is used for formal statements or future events, while "should" is used to express obligation or expectation.
2. another error is the use of "for" instead of "to" after "available". the preposition "to" is typically used to indicate the recipient or beneficiary of something being available.
3. the third error is the use of "and" instead of "or" in the phrase "taken for granted". the correct sentence uses "or" to show that the technology should not be easily available to the public, and it should not be taken for granted.
1. error: incorrect article usage
explanation: the correct sentence uses "the" before "corporate world" to specify that it is referring to a specific corporate world.

2. error: missing word and incorrect word form
explanation: the phrase "prevent employees to spending" should be corrected to "prevent employees from spending" to show the correct relationship between "prevent" and "spending." additionally, "network" should be pluralized to "networks" to match the plural subject. 

3. error: incorrect preposition
explanation: "than" should be replaced with "rather than" to show the contrast between spending time on personal leisure and concentrating on work.
1. "more of the writing skills" should be "the writing skills" to indicate that writing skills in general will be affected, not just some of them.
2. "used in the social media sites" should be "used on the social media sites" to indicate that the time is spent actively on the sites, not contained within them.
1. error: "friends are , etc." 
   correction: "friends are , etc." 
   explanation: the error is the unnecessary use of a comma before "etc." which is not required in this sentence structure.

2. error: "despite of the distance" 
   correction: "despite the distance" 
   explanation: the error is the incorrect use of the preposition "of" after "despite." the correct preposition to use in this case is "the."
1. extra comma: the error is the inclusion of a comma before "social media". commas are not typically used before the beginning of a noun phrase.
2. article "the" removed: the error is the presence of the article "the" before "social media". in this case, the article is unnecessary and should be removed for proper grammar.
1. "personal moral": the error is using "personal moral" instead of the correct term "personal morals", which refers to the principles or beliefs that guide an individual's behavior.

2. "the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them": the error is the awkward phrasing and repetition in this part of the sentence. it should be revised to "the nature of how 'directive' the risk is to them", to clarify that the decision to inform at-risk relatives depends on how direct or immediate the risk is to them.
1. error: the word "send" should be "to send" for correct grammar.
   correction: for example, we tend to send birthday wishes when facebook prompts us "today is someone's birthday".
   explanation: the addition of "to" helps complete the infinitive verb phrase "to send".

2. error: the word "wishes" should be plural to match the plural noun "birthday".
   correction: for example, we tend to send birthday wishes when facebook prompts us "today is someone's birthday".
   explanation: the noun "wishes" should agree in number with the plural noun "birthday".
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the use of "real thought" instead of "real thoughts." the correction reflects the plural form of "thoughts" to match the subject of the sentence.
2. the error in the erroneous sentence is the use of "personalities" instead of "personality." the correction reflects the singular form of "personality" to match the subject of the sentence.
1. error: "makes" should be "make"
explanation: "makes" is singular and does not agree with the plural subject "social media". the verb should be plural "make" to match the subject.

2. error: "life" should be "lives"
explanation: the sentence is referring to the lives of multiple people, so the plural form "lives" should be used instead of the singular "life".
1. "not" should be used after "can" to make the sentence negative. 
2. "by" should be used to indicate the method or action being taken. 
3. "stalking" should be replaced with a different verb to avoid promoting inappropriate or illegal behavior. 
4. "his/her" is redundant and can be simplified to "their" for gender neutrality.
1. "the best is" should be "the best" - remove "is" because it is unnecessary in this context.
2. "have be informed" should be "have been informed" - use the correct past participle form of the verb "be" after "have".
1. error: the use of "the" before "contemporary society" is unnecessary.
correction: removed "the" before "contemporary society."

2. error: missing plural form for "relationship."
correction: changed "relationship" to "relationships" to indicate multiple relationships.

3. error: unnecessary comma before "as well as," disrupting the flow of the sentence.
correction: removed the comma before "as well as."

4. error: unnecessary comma after "as well as," disrupting the flow of the sentence.
correction: removed the comma after "as well as."
1. "as soon a person" should be corrected to "as soon as a person" to show the correct use of the phrase "as soon as."
2. "a knowledge about others" should be corrected to "knowledge about others" to remove the unnecessary article "a" before "knowledge."
1. "obvioualy" is a misspelling of "obvious". 
2. there is an extra space before the comma after "side".
1. error: subject-verb agreement 
explanation: the verb "does" should agree with the singular subject "social media" instead of the plural form "do".

2. error: redundancy 
explanation: the sentence repeats the word "relationships" unnecessarily, making it repetitive and less concise.
1. "shy for" should be corrected to "shy of" - the correct idiom is "shy of" meaning to avoid or be unwilling to engage with something. 
2. "be afraid of" is correct.
1. error: the word "but" is used when contrasting two ideas, but in this sentence, the intention is to express an additional action.
correction: replace "but" with "and" to show that neglecting people around and communicating with friends on facebook are two separate actions that can both occur.

2. error: the phrasing "friends on facebook" should be capitalized, as facebook is a proper noun.
correction: capitalize "facebook" to adhere to proper grammar rules.
1. error: missing article "an" before "effective policy."
explanation: "policy" is a countable noun and requires an article before it.

2. error: missing article "the" before "innovation."
explanation: "innovation" is a specific concept in this context and requires the definite article "the" before it. 

3. error: awkward phrasing "china's pace to flourish."
explanation: the phrase "pace to flourish" is not a common or correct expression. it should be rephrased to "china's pace of flourishing" to convey the intended meaning.
1. "in the past decades" should be corrected to "in past decades" because the word "the" is unnecessary before "past decades."
2. "social media sites are" should be corrected to "social media sites were" because the sentence is referring to a past time when social media sites were not fully developed.
3. "connect with others" should be corrected to "connected with others" to maintain past tense consistency in the sentence.
4. "who live far away" should be corrected to "who lived far away" because the sentence is referring to a past time when people lived far away.
5. "by using a phone" should be corrected to "by using a phone" to maintain parallel structure in the sentence.
1. error: "the application of altering gene"
   correction: "the application of altering genes"
   explanation: the error is that "genes" should be plural in this context because there are multiple genes being altered, not just one.

2. error: "is perfected"
   correction: "are perfected"
   explanation: the error is the subject-verb agreement. "genes" is a plural noun, so the verb should also be in plural form.

3. error: "to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future "
   correction: "to give birth to babies who will have a brighter future"
   explanation: the error is in the structure of the sentence. it is unclear whether the babies are being given a brighter future or if they will have a brighter future themselves. by restructuring the sentence, the meaning becomes clearer.
1. "in the genetic field" should be "in genetic field" - the article "the" is unnecessary before the phrase "genetic field."
2. "high-velocity technological advancement" should be "high-velocity technological advancements" - since advancements is plural, the noun "technological advancement" should also be plural.
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary use of "the" before "face-to-face human contacts." the correct sentence should simply use "face-to-face human contact" as it is a general concept, not a specific instance.
2. the correct form of the verb "decreased" is used in the correction. the erroneous sentence incorrectly uses "decresed" instead of "decreased."
1. error: "researches" 
explanation: "researches" is not the correct plural form of "research." the correction uses the singular form "research" to refer to the overall findings of studies or investigations.

2. error: "people that are addicted"
explanation: "that" should be replaced with "who" when referring to people. in this case, it should be "people who are addicted" to social media sites.
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the use of "of" instead of "for" before the word "person". the correct preposition to use in this context is "for", as in "writing is an essential skill for person who express their own feelings and opinions".
2. another error is the use of the plural "person" instead of the singular "person" in the corrected sentence. since the sentence is referring to one person, it should be "writing is an essential skill for a person who expresses their own feelings and opinions."
1. error: "discriminate them" should be "discriminate against them"
explanation: the correct phrase is "discriminate against", as discrimination is an action directed towards someone, not something to be done to a person.

2. error: "with or without them" should be "with or without realizing it"
explanation: the phrase "with or without them" is unclear and does not make sense in this context. it should be "with or without realizing it" to convey the idea that people discriminate without being aware of it.
1. error: missing period 

explanation: the erroneous sentence is missing a period after "daily life", which makes the sentence run on. 

2. error: singular form instead of plural form 

explanation: the singular form "system" should be pluralized to "systems" to match the plural noun "products" in the correct sentence.
1. error: the word "become" should be changed to "becomes."
   explanation: this is a subject-verb agreement error. the subject "expressing themselves appropriately" is singular, so it should take the singular verb form "becomes."

2. error: there is a comma before "once" that is not needed.
   explanation: the comma before "once" is unnecessary as it does not separate two independent clauses or a list.
1. missing article: the error in the erroneous sentence is the missing article "the" before "internet." the correct sentence includes the article to specify and refer to the specific internet.
2. extra space: there is an extra space between "the" and "internet" in the erroneous sentence. the correct sentence does not have this extra space.
1. "each others" should be corrected to "each other" - the error here is in using "each others" as a plural form of "each other", when in fact "each other" is already a plural form referring to two or more people.
2. "more important aspect" should be corrected to "more important role" - the error here is in using "aspect" to describe the significance of face-to-face human interaction, when "role" would be a more appropriate term to convey its importance in our lives.
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary use of "the" before "society."
explanation: the word "society" is not a specific or definite noun in this context, so the article "the" should be omitted before it.

2. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary use of "on" after "elaborated."
explanation: the word "elaborated" already implies that something is being explained or developed, so the preposition "on" is unnecessary in this context.
1. apostrophe error: the possessive form of "forest" requires an apostrophe before the "s" to indicate that the view belongs to forest.
2. missing space: there should be a space between "forest" and the apostrophe to indicate possession.
1. "length" should be pluralized to "lengths" to match the plural subject "people".
2. "shorter" should be changed to "short" to correctly compare the length of words to be shorter.
1. "seconly" should be "secondly" - the correct spelling is "secondly" which means the second thing in a list or sequence.
2. "dignosis" should be "diagnosis" - the correct spelling is "diagnosis" which refers to the identification of a disease or condition through examination.
1. error: "under an accidental case"
correction: "making an unintentional discovery"
explanation: the error here is the use of the prepositional phrase "under an accidental case," which does not accurately describe the concept of serendipity. serendipity is about making discoveries unintentionally, not under a specific case or scenario.

2. error: "results the invention of a new technology"
correction: "results in the invention of a new technology"
explanation: the error in this phrase is the missing preposition "in" after "results." the correct preposition should be used to show the relationship between two actions: the unintentional discovery leading to the invention of new technology.
1. error: missing "the" before "better habit"
explanation: in the incorrect sentence, "a" is used instead of "the" before "better habit." this is incorrect because we are referring to a specific "better habit" that will be developed.

2. error: missing "the" before "better for the rest"
explanation: in the incorrect sentence, "better for the rest of their lives" is missing "the" before "better." adding "the" indicates that we are specifying a specific improvement in their lives.
1. "as the result" should be "as a result": the error is using the incorrect article "the" instead of "a" before the word "result".
2. "telling the genetic testing result is needed" should be "to tell the genetic testing result is needed": the error is in the structure of the sentence, as it is missing the preposition "to" before the verb "tell".
1. "supports" should be corrected to "support" as the verb "must be provided" is singular, therefore requiring a singular noun to match.
2. "standing of such junction" should be corrected to "standing at such a junction" to properly indicate the location.
3. "whether should him/her" should be corrected to "whether they should" to use a gender-neutral pronoun and correct subject-verb agreement.
4. "to inform the relatives" is grammatically correct, but could be improved by adding "of their whereabouts" for clarity.
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the use of the article "a" before the word "research." in the corrected sentence, "research" is used without the article "a" because it is referring to a general body of research rather than a specific study.
2. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary comma after "also." in the corrected sentence, the comma is removed to improve the flow and clarity of the sentence.
3. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary use of the word "the" before "facebook." in the corrected sentence, "facebook" is used without the article "the" because it is a proper noun.
4. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary use of the word "the" before "users." in the corrected sentence, "users" is used without the article "the" because it is referring to users in general rather than specific users.
1. error: "equally"
   correction: "equally"
   explanation: the error is a grammatical mistake. the correct word should be "equally" instead of "equally" to convey the intended meaning that other family members have almost the same level of risk.

2. error: "to have it"
   correction: "of have it"
   explanation: the error is a preposition usage mistake. the correct preposition should be "of" instead of "to" to show possession and indicate that other family members also have almost the same risk of having the genetic disorder.
1. error: "did" should be "do"
   explanation: the verb "do" should be used to maintain parallel structure with the verb "do" in the second part of the sentence.

2. error: "computer" should be "computers"
   explanation: "personal computer" should be pluralized to maintain consistency with the other devices listed (laptops, tablets).

3. error: "internet" should be "the internet"
   explanation: "the internet" is a specific reference to the global network of computers, so it should be preceded by the definite article "the."
1. extra comma after "that": the error is an unnecessary comma after the word "that". commas are not needed after subordinating conjunctions like "that" in this sentence. 
2. "relfected" should be "reflected": the error is a spelling mistake. the correct spelling of the word is "reflected".
1. "on" should be replaced with "with" to show agreement or disagreement with a statement, idea, or argument.
2. there is repetition in the phrase "should not be used to track people," which can be simplified by removing the redundancy.
1. error: the word "with" is unnecessary and redundant. 
correction: the existence of social media sites

2. error: the verb "have" should be changed to "has" to agree with the singular subject "existence".
correction: the existence of social media sites has

3. error: the phrase "they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends" is a run-on sentence and lacks proper punctuation.
correction: they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends.
1. error: "the social media" 
   correction: "social media"
   explanation: the word "social media" is a collective noun and does not require the definite article "the" before it.

2. error: "on the social media and the internet"
   correction: "on social media and the internet"
   explanation: similar to the first error, "social media" is a collective noun and does not require the definite article "the" before it.

3. error: "more advance"
   correction: "more advanced"
   explanation: the correct form is "more advanced" as it is the comparative form of the adjective "advanced."
1. "people" should be followed by "with" to show the relationship between the subject and the way of talking and chatting.
2. the phrase "a way of communication" should be "a way of communicating" to use the correct form of the verb after the preposition "of".
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary use of the article "the" before "interpersonal skills." the correction removed the article to make it grammatically correct.
2. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary use of the pronoun "us" before "to communicate." the correction removed the pronoun to make it more concise and grammatically correct.
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the missing article "a" before the word "need".
2. the correct sentence includes the article "a" to properly identify the singular noun "need".
1. missing "the" before "time": the error occurred because the sentence needs to specify that it is referring to a specific amount of time, requiring the definite article "the" before "time."
2. missing "the" before "human": the error happened because the sentence needs to specify that it is referring to a specific group of humans, requiring the definite article "the" before "human."
1. "lesser" should be "less": "less" is used to compare two quantities that are not equal, while "lesser" is used to compare two qualities or values.
2. remove "the" before "china": in this context, "china" does not require an article before it.
1. "latest news and updates" - the error here is the missing article "the" before "latest news and updates." this article is needed to make the sentence grammatically correct.
2. "a click away on the refresh button" - the error here is the use of "on" after "click away." the correct preposition to use in this context is "from," not "on."
1. "may indicates" should be "may indicate" - this is an error in subject-verb agreement, where the verb "indicate" should agree with the singular noun "risk" rather than "risks." 
2. "to carry" should be "of carrying" - this is a prepositional error, where the preposition "of" should be used to show possession or association between the risk and the likelihood of carrying a disease.
1. "emotinal" should be "emotional": the spelling of the word "emotional" is incorrect in the erroneous sentence.

2. "thoughts" in relation to emotions: "emotional thoughts" may not be the most accurate phrase as thoughts are generally considered to be cognitive processes rather than emotional states. it may be more appropriate to say "emotional well-being" or "emotional state" instead.
1. error: "more convenient contact environment" should be "a more convenient contact environment"
explanation: the indefinite article "a" is needed before "more convenient contact environment" to show that it is one of many possible environments, not a specific one.

2. error: "each others" should be "each other"
explanation: "each other" is a reciprocal pronoun used to indicate a mutual relationship between two or more people.
1. "discuss about" is redundant. the correct phrase is simply "discuss."
2. "the" before "down sides" is unnecessary. "down sides" can stand alone without an article.
3. "the" before "contemporary society" is unnecessary. "contemporary society" can stand alone without an article.
1. "the" before "surveillance technology": the word "the" is unnecessary before "surveillance technology" as it is not referring to a specific type of surveillance technology.
2. "invading" should be "safeguarding": the word "invading" suggests a negative impact on human privacy, while the correct word "safeguarding" implies protecting or ensuring privacy.
3. extra space before the comma: there is an extra space before the comma after "privacy", which is grammatically incorrect.
1. error: "genetic gene" should be "genes"
   explanation: the word "genetic" already implies that it's related to genes, so using "genetic gene" is redundant.

2. error: missing capitalization for "genes" at the beginning of the sentence.
   explanation: in english, the first letter of a sentence should always be capitalized.
1. error: "says" should be "say"
   explanation: the subject "many people" is plural, so the verb should also be in its plural form "say" instead of "says."

2. error: "the social media" should be "social media"
   explanation: "social media" is a mass noun and does not require an article "the" before it.

3. error: unnecessary repetition of "the" before "friends"
   explanation: the sentence should be more concise, so the repetition of "the" before "friends" is unnecessary and can be removed.
1. error: "passed" should be "passes"
   explanation: the verb tense should be present tense "passes" to match the present tense in the rest of the sentence.

2. error: missing comma after "list"
   explanation: a comma is needed after "list" to separate two independent clauses in a compound sentence.
1. error: "interpersonal skill" should be "interpersonal skills"
   explanation: the plural form "skills" is needed to refer to the various abilities involved in interacting with others.

2. error: the comma after "somebody" is unnecessary.
   explanation: the comma should not be used before the conjunction "but" in this sentence.
1. the error in "there are many people in the social media" is the incorrect use of the preposition "in" before "social media." the correct preposition to use in this context is "on."
2. the error in "beautiful image" is the lack of the plural form. "image" should be pluralized to "images" to match with "good content."
3. the error in "do not have jobs" is the unnecessary use of "do" before "not." the correct form is "may not have jobs."
4. the error in "live poorly" is the use of "live" instead of "living." the correct form is "live poorly" or "living poorly."
1. "is" should be changed to "was" to match the past tense of the sentence since it is referring to a time in the past.
2. "him" should be changed to "it" since "technology" is a singular noun and requires a singular pronoun to refer back to it.
1. "on the communication between people" - the error here is the use of the unnecessary article "the" before "communication." the correct sentence should not have "the" before "communication."
2. "for the society" - the error here is the unnecessary article "the" before "society." the correct sentence should not have "the" before "society."
1. "study" should be "studying" to indicate the continuous action of studying.
2. "oversea" should be "overseas" to indicate studying in a foreign country.
3. "contact" should be "contacting" to indicate the action of reaching out to old friends. 
4. "friend" should be "friends" to indicate that there is more than one old friend being referred to.
1. "human" should be pluralized to "humans" to agree with the plural subject of the sentence.
2. "their" should be changed to "have" to make the sentence grammatically correct.
1. "her" should be "his" - the possessive pronoun should match the gender of the subject. in this case, the subject is "he," so the possessive pronoun should be "his" daughter.
2. "via internet" should be "via the internet" - the correct phrase includes the definite article "the" before "internet" to specify a particular internet network.
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the use of "for" after "seeking out." the correction removes "for" so the correct sentence reads "seeking out attention." 

explanation: "seeking out" is a phrasal verb that does not require the preposition "for" after it. 

2. another error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary inclusion of "for" before "attention." 

explanation: the correction removes the extra word "for," which is not needed in this context.
1. error: "claimed" should be "claim"
   explanation: the verb "claim" should be used in the present tense to match the rest of the sentence, as it is referring to what teenagers today currently do.

2. error: comma after "media"
   explanation: there should not be a comma after "media" as it disrupts the flow of the sentence and separates the subject ("many of the teenagers today") from the verb ("claim").
1. "comes" should be "come" because the subject "advantages" is plural.
2. "application" should be "applications" to match the plural subject "media sites." 
3. "in" should be "on" to show the platform being used.
1. "annouance" should be "announce" - the error here is a simple spelling mistake.
2. "check" should be "checks" - the error is in the grammatical agreement between the subject "people" and the verb "check."
3. "creat" should be "create" - the error here is another spelling mistake.
1. error 1: "unsafe online environment" should be followed by a verb form, such as "spending", to make the sentence grammatically correct.
2. error 2: "internet" should have the word "the" before it to make it grammatically correct.
1. "fused by fellow engineers" should be changed to "by fellow engineers" as the word "fused" is unnecessary and does not make sense in this context.
2. "developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds" should be changed to "developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to" as the phrase "on to cater to desired deeds" is redundant and unclear.
1. error: incorrect preposition
correction: "get" should be changed to "put"
explanation: the verb "put" is commonly used in this context to indicate causing someone to be in a dangerous situation. "get" does not convey the intended meaning in this sentence.

2. error: lack of parallel structure
correction: "loved ones in danger" should be parallel to "their loved ones who they really are"
explanation: in order to maintain clarity and consistency in the sentence, it is important for the phrases to be structured in a parallel manner.
1. "lost" should be corrected to "loss" as it is a noun form that is needed in this context.
2. there is a missing article "the" before "interpersonal skills".
1. "to" should be replaced with "of" - the error occurred because the correct preposition to follow "cause" is "of" instead of "to." 
2. "give" should be replaced with "gives" - the error occurred because the verb should agree in number with its subject, which in this case is "cause."
1. "seen" should be "see": the correct verb form is "see" to maintain subject-verb agreement in present tense.
2. "in" should be removed: the preposition "in" is unnecessary in this context and should be omitted for clarity.
1. "a unhealthy" should be "an unhealthy" because "unhealthy" starts with a vowel sound (u).
2. "the end" should be added before "marriage" to indicate that it is specifically referring to the end of their marriage.
1. error: missing comma after "situation"
   explanation: a comma is needed after "situation" to separate the introductory phrase "this can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation" from the rest of the sentence.

2. error: unnecessary use of "in" before "particularly"
   explanation: the word "in" before "particularly" is unnecessary and should be removed to improve the clarity and correctness of the sentence.

3. error: redundant use of "the" before "small children"
   explanation: the use of "the" before "small children" is redundant and should be removed for smoother sentence structure.
1. error: misuse of commas
explanation: the erroneous sentence incorrectly uses commas to separate the list of five basic design processes, which should be separated by commas and then followed by "which are" to introduce the list.
2. error: lack of parallel structure
explanation: the erroneous sentence lacks parallel structure in the list of five basic design processes by not consistently using the same format for each item in the list. this lack of consistency makes the sentence unclear and confusing.
1. error: "medias" should be "media"
explanation: "media" is the plural form of "medium," so it should be used in the singular form when referring to social media platforms as a whole.

2. error: missing article "on"
explanation: the preposition "on" should be used before the term "social media" to indicate the platform on which the person feels more at ease.
1. "contacts" should be singular "contact": the error is pluralizing the word "contact" when it should be singular to refer to the general concept of face-to-face human interaction.
2. "decresed" should be "decreased": the error is a misspelling of the word "decreased," which is the correct verb form in this context.
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary article "a" before the word "research". this error is corrected in the correct sentence by removing the article "a". 
2. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary comma before "according to research". this error is corrected in the correct sentence by removing the comma. 
3. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary article "the" before the word "users". this error is corrected in the correct sentence by removing the article "the". 
4. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary article "the" before the word "facebook". this error is corrected in the correct sentence by removing the article "the".
1. error: using "but" instead of "and"
   explanation: the error in the erroneous sentence occurs because the conjunction "but" implies a contrast between neglecting people surrounding them and communicating only with friends. however, the intended meaning is to show that neglecting people leads to only communicating with friends, so the correct conjunction to use is "and."

2. error: lack of parallel structure
   explanation: the erroneous sentence lacks parallel structure because it starts with "one may neglect" but does not continue the parallel structure by using the same form for the second action. by using "communicate" instead of "just communicate," the correct sentence maintains parallel structure.
1. the error in the sentence is in the use of "dinners" instead of "dinner." the correct word in this context is "dinner" since it refers to the specific meal being eaten, not multiple meals.
2. the error is in the use of the possessive pronoun "their" before "holding." the correct form is "they're," which is a contraction of "they are," to indicate that they are holding and looking at their display screen.
1. "dilemma" should be pluralized to "dilemmas" to match the plural subject "more family-related ethical dilemmas."
2. "family-related ethical" should be hyphenated to show that the phrase is acting as a single adjective describing the dilemmas.
1. error: "give" should be corrected to "gives"
explanation: the verb "give" should agree with the singular subject "wife", so it should be in the third person singular form "gives".

2. error: missing comma after "risk"
explanation: a comma is needed before "as well" to separate the two independent clauses in the sentence.
1. error: "site" should be pluralized as "sites".
explanation: the phrase "social network sites" refers to multiple websites or platforms, not just one site. 

2. error: missing article "a" before "place".
explanation: in english, we typically use an article before a singular noun, in this case "a place to show off".
1. error: "because that" 
   correction: remove "that"
   explanation: the word "because" already functions as a subordinating conjunction, so using "that" after it is unnecessary and grammatically incorrect. 

2. error: "time" 
   correction: "times"
   explanation: in this context, "hard times" is a common phrase used to refer to difficult situations or challenges. using the singular form "time" is incorrect and should be pluralized to "times."
1. "on chatting" should be corrected to "chatting" because the preposition "on" before "chatting" is unnecessary.
2. "communicate" should be corrected to "communicating" to maintain parallel structure with "chatting."
3. "interpersonal skill" should be corrected to "interpersonal skills" because it is referring to multiple skills, not just one.
1. "the parent" should be corrected to "the parents" to indicate that there is more than one parent that the children rely on.
2. "rely" should be followed by "on" to show what or whom the children are depending on.
1. error: "causing" should be changed to "cause"
explanation: the conjunction "and" is used to connect two verbs in a parallel structure, so both verbs should be in the base form "cause" to maintain parallelism.

2. error: repetition of "may be"
explanation: the phrase "may be harmful" contains unnecessary repetition, so it is more concise to just say "that may be harmful."
1. "the manufacture company" should be corrected to "the manufacturer company": this error involves using the wrong form of the word "manufacturer," which refers to a company that produces goods. 
2. "the company that the innovators are working for" should be corrected to "the company that innovators are working for": the use of "the" before "innovators" is unnecessary and causes awkward phrasing in the sentence.
1. "a lots of money" should be corrected to "a lot of money" - using "a lots" is grammatically incorrect, the correct phrase is "a lot".
2. "be the burden in her family" should be corrected to "be a burden in her family" - the use of the article "the" is unnecessary in this context, "a burden" is the correct phrase.
1. "on" should be corrected to "in" because we usually say we read or see something "in" a newspaper, not "on" a newspaper.
2. there is an extra space after the word "on" that should be removed for correct grammar and spacing.
1. error: "and if agrees"
correction: "and agrees"

explanation: the error is in the use of "if agrees" which is grammatically incorrect. the correct form is simply "and agrees" to show the continuation of the thought process without the conditional "if."

2. error: no explanation provided

explanation: the second error is in the missing explanation after the correction.
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the use of the article "the" before "innovators." in this context, "innovators" is a general noun, so the article is not needed. 
2. the use of the articles "the" before "innovators" in the erroneous sentence is incorrect because "innovators" is a general term and does not require a specific article.
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary article "the" before "society". removing the article makes the sentence grammatically correct because "society" is a general concept, not a specific or unique one that requires the definite article.
1. "certain disease" should replace "got certain disease" because the sentence is describing the presence of a disease rather than the act of receiving it.
2. "altitudes" should be changed to "attitudes" as it is referring to the feelings and opinions of others.
3. "caring us too much" should be changed to "caring for us too much" to accurately convey the idea of showing concern and support.
4. "keeping away from us" is correct but could also be revised to "avoiding us" for a clearer meaning.
1. error: the word "the" before "people" is unnecessary.
explanation: "people" is a general term and does not require the definite article "the" before it.

2. error: "wrong testing" should be corrected to "wrong tests."
explanation: "wrong testing" is grammatically incorrect; the noun form should be used, which is "tests" in this context.
1. error: "restric" should be "restrict"
explanation: the correct spelling of the word is "restrict", with a "t" at the end. this verb is used to show that something is limited or prevented.

2. error: the use of "obligation" instead of "obligatory"
explanation: "obligation" refers to a duty or commitment that one is required to fulfill, while "obligatory" means something that is compulsory or mandatory. in this context, "obligatory" would be more appropriate to describe the requirement.
1. "status" should be changed to "statuses" to be grammatically correct. the plural form is needed because it refers to multiple statuses.
2. there is no error in this sentence.
1. the error in the sentence is the placement of the word "for" in "stay another year in secondary school." the correction includes the word "for" after "stay," making it "stay for another year in the secondary school." this change clarifies that the student is staying for an additional year at the secondary school.
2. the error in the sentence is the phrase "top 1 student in his province," which has been corrected to "top student in his province." this change provides clarity and removes redundancy in the sentence.
1. the error in the sentence is the incorrect use of the verb "are also been used." the correct form should be "have also been used" to indicate that the action of using implants and products as surveillance tools occurred in the past.

2. the usage of "have" instead of "are" indicates that the action of using implants and products for surveillance took place in the past, which is the correct tense for this context.
1. error: "social media site" should be "social media sites" because the sentence is referring to multiple sites.
2. error: "bring in" should be "bring" to correct the grammar of the sentence.
3. error: "effect" should be "effects" to match the plural form of "some negative." 
4. error: "life" should be "lives" to match the plural subject "our daily."
1. "immediate" should be "immediately": the adverb "immediately" is used to describe the verb "disseminate," indicating how the action is carried out in a timely manner. adding the "-ly" suffix properly forms the adverb.
1. aids should be singular (aid) because it is being used as a singular noun in this context to refer to the assistance or help provided by social media.
2. bonds should be singular (bond) to agree with the subject "people." 
3. lives should be plural (humans) to agree with the subject "people."
4. happily should be changed to live to maintain parallel structure with the preceding verbs (bond and flow).
1. error: the word "the" before "genetic testing" is unnecessary.
explanation: the word "the" should be removed because genetic testing is a general concept, not a specific instance.

2. error: "disorder problem" is redundant.
explanation: "disorder" already implies a problem, so the word "problem" is unnecessary and can be removed to avoid repetition.
1. error: "one the closest"
correction: "one of the closest"
explanation: the phrase "one of" is used to indicate a single entity belonging to a larger group, whereas "one the" is grammatically incorrect.

2. error: "group" should be plural "groups"
correction: "group of people" should be "groups of people"
explanation: the sentence is referring to multiple groups of people within the family, so the plural form "groups" should be used instead of the singular form "group". 

3. error: "is" should be "are"
correction: "is a crucial factor" should be "are a crucial factor"
explanation: since the subject "family members" is plural, the verb should also be plural to match, therefore "are" should be used instead of "is". 

4. error: "possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder"
correction: "possible troubles caused by genetic disorders"
explanation: the correct phrasing is "caused by genetic disorders" as it clarifies that the troubles are a result of genetic disorders.
1. in the erroneous sentence, "thousand" should be pluralized to "thousands" to match the plural subject "genetic risk diseases."
2. "provide helps" should be corrected to "provide help" to use the correct form of the verb after the noun "associations."
3. the phrase "is an utmost help" should be revised to "is of utmost help" to correctly convey the intended meaning of extreme importance.
1. "create" should be replaced with "use": the error is using the word "create" instead of "use", as the sentence is referring to utilizing or selecting existing materials rather than creating new ones.
2. "the" before "buildings" should be removed: the error is including the article "the" before "buildings", which is unnecessary in this context and makes the sentence awkward.
3. "despite" should be replaced with "during": the error is using "despite" which implies that the material does not actually support the buildings during natural disasters, while "during" accurately conveys that it is meant to provide support in these situations.
4. a comma should be added after "disasters": the error is missing a comma after "natural disasters" to separate clauses and improve readability.
1. error: "device" should be pluralized to "devices"
   explanation: the word "devices" should be used instead of "device" since the sentence is referring to more than one electronic device.

2. error: "until" should be replaced with "that"
   explanation: the word "until" suggests a time limit, whereas "that" is a more appropriate conjunction to show causation between the effectiveness of auto correction software and the lack of realization about the importance of writing.
