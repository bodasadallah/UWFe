Error_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: qualified, Correction: 

The error is the use of the adjective "qualified" to describe the human resource. In this context, "qualified" is not the correct word to use. Instead, the correct word is "human" which is a noun referring to the people who make up the resource. The phrase "creative human resources" means the people who are creative and make up the resources available.

2. Error: resource, Correction: resources

The error is the use of the singular noun "resource" when the correct word is the plural noun "resources". The phrase "creative human resources" refers to multiple people who are creative and make up the resources available. Using the singular form "resource" would imply that there is only one person, which is not the intended meaning.
cleaned: 1. Error: qualified, Correction:
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle. 




Error_sentence: On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Correct_sentence: On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "side" -> Correction: "hand"

The error is a mistake in the preposition used. The original sentence uses "side", which is incorrect in this context. The correct preposition is "hand", which is used to indicate a contrast or a different perspective. For example, "On the other hand" is a common idiomatic expression used to introduce a contrasting idea or a different point of view.

2. Error: "want" -> Correction: "wants"

The error is a mistake in verb agreement. The subject of the sentence is "a person", which is a singular noun. Therefore, the verb "wants" should be used instead of "want", which is a plural form of the verb. The correction ensures that the verb agrees with the subject in number.
cleaned: 1. Error: "side" -> Correction: "hand"
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Error_sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct_sentence: One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: disadvantage, Correction: disadvantages

The error is a plural error. The original sentence uses the singular noun "disadvantage", but the correct sentence uses the plural noun "disadvantages" because it is referring to multiple disadvantages. In English, when we are referring to more than one thing, we use the plural form of the noun.

2. Error: the, Correction: (no correction needed)

This error is actually a non-error! The original sentence has "the" before "disadvantage", and the corrected sentence also has "the" before "disadvantages". There is no correction needed for this part of the sentence.

3. Error: of, Correction: in

The error is a preposition error. The original sentence uses the preposition "of" to describe the relationship between "people" and "interest", but the correct sentence uses the preposition "in" to indicate that people lose interest in something. The preposition "in" is more commonly used to indicate a relationship of involvement or participation, whereas "of" is often used to indicate possession or belonging.
cleaned: 1. Error: disadvantage, Correction: disadvantages
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.




Error_sentence: I agree that RFID technology shall not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
Correct_sentence: I agree that RFID technology should not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
Prediction: Based on the given information, here is a simple explanation for the error:

Error 1: "shall" instead of "should"

The error is a mistake in the verb tense used in the sentence. "Shall" is a modal verb that is typically used to express obligation, duty, or necessity in the first person singular (I) and third person singular (he/she/it) in the present tense. For example, "I shall attend the meeting" means that it is necessary for the speaker to attend the meeting.

On the other hand, "should" is a modal verb that is used to express possibility, permission, or recommendation in the first person singular (I) and third person singular (he/she/it) in the present tense. For example, "I should attend the meeting" means that it would be a good idea for the speaker to attend the meeting.

In the given sentence, "shall not" is used to express prohibition, which is incorrect. The correct verb tense to use in this sentence is "should not", which expresses the idea that it is not recommended or advisable for RFID technology to be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 




Error_sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Correct_sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

**Error 1: "with" instead of "for"**

The erroneous sentence uses "with" to describe the relationship between companies and cash reimbursement, whereas the correct sentence uses "for". The correct phrase "for cash reimbursement" indicates that the companies receive cash reimbursement as a result of the leaks, whereas "with" would imply a coexistence or association between companies and cash reimbursement.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.




Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: Researches, Correction: Research

The error is a plural noun form ("Researches") used instead of a singular noun form ("Research"). The correct sentence uses the singular form "Research" because it is a noun referring to a single study or investigation.
cleaned: 1. Error: Researches, Correction: Research
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Correct_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason for the halt of the work was that the higher level authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "of" instead of "for"
Explanation: In this sentence, "of" is a preposition that is used to indicate possession or origin, whereas "for" is a preposition that is used to indicate purpose or intention. In this case, the correct word is "for" because it indicates the reason for the halt of work, which is the higher level authorities' thought about the underground traffic system.

2. Error: missing article "the" before "reason"
Explanation: The article "the" is necessary to specify which reason is being referred to. Without it, the sentence is unclear and ambiguous. The correct sentence uses "the reason" to indicate a specific reason, which is the halt of work.

3. Error: missing article "the" before "work"
Explanation: Similar to the previous error, the article "the" is necessary to specify which work is being referred to. Without it, the sentence is unclear and ambiguous. The correct sentence uses "the work" to indicate a specific work, which is the halt of work.

4. Error: "of" instead of no correction (i.e., no correction needed)
Explanation: In this case, there is no correction needed because
cleaned: 1. Error: "of" instead of "for"
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.




Error_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Correct_sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Prediction: Here is a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: polices -> police

The error is a typo, where the word "polices" is written instead of the correct word "police". This is likely due to a careless mistake while typing. The correct word "police" refers to a law enforcement agency that deals with cybercrimes, whereas "polices" is a plural form of "police" that doesn't make sense in this context.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".




Error_sentence: When electronic devices are not grounded properly , there is a probability that the user might get an electric shock when he/she accidentally come into contact with the device .
Correct_sentence: When electronic devices are not grounded properly , there is a probability that the user might get an electric shock when he/she accidentally comes into contact with the device .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Error 1: come -> comes

The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. In the sentence, the subject is "he/she" which is a singular pronoun. Therefore, the verb "comes" should be used instead of "come" to agree with the subject. "Come" is a plural verb, used for multiple people or things, whereas "comes" is the singular form used for a single person or thing.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The subject is "he/she," which is singular, so the verb should be singular for subject-verb agreement.




Error_sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct_sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Prediction: Based on the given information, here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "rely the" -> Correction: "on"
Explanation: The error is a missing preposition. The correct phrase should be "rely on", not "rely the". The word "on" is a preposition that indicates the basis or means by which something is done, whereas "the" is an article that modifies a noun. In this context, "on" is necessary to convey the correct meaning of relying on someone or something.

2. Error: "parent" -> Correction: "parents"
Explanation: The error is a singular noun used in place of a plural noun. The subject of the sentence is "children", which is a plural noun, so the correct object of the preposition "to" should also be plural. The word "parent" refers to one person, whereas "parents" refers to multiple people. In this context, "parents" is necessary to agree with the plural subject "children".
cleaned: 1. Error: "rely the" -> Correction: "on"
Label: 1. Missing word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. This sentence is either referring to the parents of specific children, or parents and children in general, but either way, "parents" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: To put it in the nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Correct_sentence: To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Error 1: "the" instead of "a"
Explanation: The error is using the definite article "the" instead of the indefinite article "a" before the noun "nutshell". The correct sentence uses "a nutshell" because it's a general reference to a nutshell, not a specific one. In this context, "a" is the correct choice because it implies a general or unspecified nutshell.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. "In a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. The phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but the specificity of "the" makes it sound literal. Instead of referring figuratively to something very simple, it would mean something that is literally inside a nutshell.




Error_sentence: This essay will discuss about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
Correct_sentence: This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: about, Correction:

The error is using the preposition "about" in the phrase "the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life". The correct phrase is "the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives". The word "about" is often used to introduce a topic or subject, but in this case, it's not necessary. The phrase "in our daily life" is already describing the topic, so the preposition "about" is redundant and should be removed.

2. Error: life, Correction: lives

The error is using the singular noun "life" instead of the plural noun "lives" in the phrase "in our daily life". The phrase should read "in our daily lives" because it's describing the daily routines and experiences of people, which is a plural concept. Using the singular noun "life" would imply a single, specific life, which is not the intended meaning.
cleaned: 1. Error: about, Correction:
Label: 1. "Discuss" does not need to be followed by a preposition.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connect people globally .
Correct_sentence: It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

**Error 1:**
**Original word:** connect
**Corrected word:** connects
**Explanation:** The error is a verb tense inconsistency. The sentence starts with "saves" (past simple tense), which indicates a completed action. However, "connect" is a present tense verb, which doesn't match the verb tense of the rest of the sentence. To maintain consistency, the corrected verb "connects" (present simple tense) is used, indicating a general truth or ongoing action.

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these explanations!
cleaned: 
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Error_sentence: When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends .
Correct_sentence: When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use social media to get in contact with our friends .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: the, Correction: 

Explanation: The error is the absence of the word "social" before "media". The correct sentence should read "social media" to refer to online platforms where people share information and communicate with each other.

2. Error:  , Correction: in

Explanation: The error is the unnecessary comma after "media". The correct sentence should read "to get in contact" to indicate the purpose of using social media, which is to establish communication with others. The comma is not needed in this context.
cleaned: 1. Error: the, Correction:
Label: 1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. Missing word. The correct expression is "get in contact".




Error_sentence: Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service , personal profile , media of sharing , and other entertainment add-on ( i.e .
Correct_sentence: Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service , personal profile , media of sharing , and other entertainment add-ons ( i.e .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Error 1: add-on -> add-ons

The error is a pluralization mistake. In the original sentence, "add-on" is a singular noun, but it should be pluralized to "add-ons" because it is being used to describe multiple entertainment features. The correction is to change the singular "add-on" to the plural form "add-ons" to maintain grammatical accuracy and consistency.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The sentence is discussing add-ons in general, so "add-on" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .
Correct_sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: The, Correction: However,

The original sentence starts with "The", which is an article that indicates a specific or previously mentioned noun. However, the corrected sentence starts with "However", which is a conjunctive adverb that introduces a contrasting idea. This error is likely due to the writer's failure to recognize the correct transition word to use in this context.

2. Error: using, Correction: use

The original sentence uses the present participle "using" to describe the action of people using the thing. However, the corrected sentence uses the base form "use" to describe the action. This error is likely due to the writer's failure to recognize the correct verb form to use in this context.

3. Error: over, Correction: on

The original sentence uses the preposition "over" to describe the relationship between the people and the thing. However, the corrected sentence uses the preposition "on" to describe the same relationship. This error is likely due to the writer's failure to recognize the correct preposition to use in this context.

4. Error: on, Correction: over

The original sentence uses the preposition "on" to describe the relationship between the people and the thing
cleaned: 1. Error: The, Correction: However,
Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.




Error_sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .
Correct_sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child .
Prediction: Based on the given information, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: their -> the

The error is a possessive pronoun mistake. In the original sentence, "their" is used to indicate possession, implying that the parents' right belongs to them. However, in this context, "the" is the correct choice because it refers to a general right, not a specific right belonging to the parents. The corrected sentence uses "the" to indicate a universal right, rather than a possessive one.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".




Error_sentence: Overall , I belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
Correct_sentence: Overall , I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

1. Error: belive, Correction: believe

The error is a misspelling of the word "believe". The correct spelling is "believe", which is a verb that means to have confidence in something or someone. The word "belive" is not a valid word in English, and it's likely that the writer meant to type "believe" instead.
cleaned: 1. Error: belive, Correction: believe
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "believe."




Error_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .
Correct_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers from making more effort to do research and design , and they have little motivation to work hard .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "to make" -> Correction: "from making"

The error is a grammatical mistake. The phrase "to make" is not suitable in this context. The correct phrase "from making" is used to indicate the action of making effort is being prevented or discouraged, which is the intended meaning.

2. Error: "for" -> Correction: "and"

The error is a logical mistake. The word "for" is used to introduce a reason or purpose, whereas in this sentence, it's used to connect two independent clauses. The correct word "and" is used to indicate a conjunction between the two clauses.

3. Error: "will" -> Correction: (no correction needed)

The error is a misunderstanding of the sentence structure. The sentence is already in the present tense, describing the current state of engineers being discouraged. There is no need for the word "will" to indicate future tense, as the sentence is not describing a future event.
cleaned: 1. Error: "to make" -> Correction: "from making"
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."




Error_sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other 's permission , this should not be placed or implanted to anyone .
Correct_sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without permission , this technology should not be placed or implanted in anyone .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "other 's", Correction: ""

Explanation: The error is a possessive form ("other 's") that is not necessary in this sentence. The phrase "without permission" is a noun phrase that functions as an adverb, indicating the condition under which the action should not be placed or implanted. Therefore, the possessive form is unnecessary and should be removed.

2. Error: "", Correction: "technology"

Explanation: The error is the insertion of an empty space between the words. This is likely a typo or a formatting issue. The correct sentence should read "without permission, this technology" without any spaces between the words.

3. Error: "to", Correction: "in"

Explanation: The error is the use of the preposition "to" instead of "in". The correct preposition "in" is necessary to indicate the location where the technology should not be placed or implanted. "To" would imply a direction or movement, which is not the intended meaning in this context.
cleaned: 1. Error: "other 's", Correction: ""
Label: 1. As "permission" is something granted by another person, this is already taken for granted without needing to explicitly say "other's". 
2. You should explicitly state "technology" for clarity.
3. An implant goes inside the body, so you need to use "in" accordingly.




Error_sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .
Correct_sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one year ago,when I just arrived singapore .
Prediction: Based on the erroneous sentence "I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore" and the correct sentence "I started invoving into Facebook one year ago,when I just arrived singapore", I can identify the error and provide a simple explanation for each error as follows:

Error 1: years, Correction: year

Explanation: The error is a plural form "years" instead of the singular form "year". The correct sentence uses the singular form "year" to indicate a specific point in time.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The phrase "one year" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "years," so it should be the singular "year."




Error_sentence: Therefore , I thought a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Prediction: Here is a simple explanation for each error:

**Error 1: "thought" instead of "think"**

The error is a verb tense mistake. "Thought" is a past tense verb, whereas "think" is the present tense verb. In this sentence, "think" is the correct choice because it is expressing the speaker's current opinion or judgment. "Thought" would imply that the speaker had a thought in the past, which is not the intended meaning in this context.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. You are expressing an opinion that you hold now, not something that you thought in the past, so you should use the present tense, "think".




Error_sentence: Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies for spying and advertising .
Correct_sentence: Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transferred to the companies for spying and advertising .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for the error:

Error 1: "transfer" -> "transferred"

The error is a verb tense inconsistency. In the sentence, "is recorded" is in the present perfect tense, indicating an action that started in the past and continues up to the present. However, "transfer" is in the simple present tense, which doesn't match the tense of the rest of the sentence. To maintain consistency, the correct verb form should be "transferred", which is the past participle of the verb "to transfer" and agrees with the present perfect tense of "is recorded".
cleaned: 
Label: 1. This is the passive voice, continuing from the phrase "is recorded." The passive voice requires a form of the verb "to be" followed by a secondary verb, which is always the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "transfer" to the past participle "transferred."




Error_sentence: Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
Correct_sentence: Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: shwing, Correction: showing

The error is a typo, where the word "shwing" is incorrectly written instead of the correct word "showing". "Shwing" is not a valid word in English, and it seems that the writer meant to use the verb "showing", which means to display or exhibit something, in this case, pictures. The correct sentence should read "Besides, there are more people showing their pictures...".

2. Error: experience, Correction: experiences

The error is a singular-plural mismatch, where the word "experience" is incorrectly used instead of the correct word "experiences". The sentence is describing multiple experiences of people (travelling experiences), so the correct word should be the plural form "experiences". The correct sentence should read "Besides, there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences...".
cleaned: 1. Error: shwing, Correction: showing
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."
2. The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.




Error_sentence: Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is more easier than asking people around in real life .
Correct_sentence: Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is easier than asking people around in real life .
Prediction: Here is the explanation for each error:

Error 1: "more" -> "easier"
Explanation: The word "more" is an adjective used to describe the degree or extent of something. In this sentence, it doesn't make sense to say that finding old friends through Facebook is "more easier" because "easier" is already an adjective describing the difficulty of the task. Instead, we simply say that it is "easier" than asking people around in real life.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. "More" is never used with "easier" because "easier" already contains the sense of it being "more".




Error_sentence: However , since internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Correct_sentence: However , since the internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Prediction: Based on the given information, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: "internet" -> "the internet"

Explanation: The error is the lack of the definite article "the" before the noun "internet". In English, when referring to a specific entity, such as the internet, we use the definite article "the" to indicate that we are talking about a particular instance or entity.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.

Correct_sentence: It is weird that people sit around the table but all face their phones and do not talk with to other .
Prediction: Based on the given information, here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: with, Correction: to

The error is the use of the preposition "with" instead of "to" in the phrase "do not talk with to other". The correct phrase should be "do not talk to other" because "to" is the correct preposition to use when referring to the direction of conversation. In this context, "to" indicates the direction of the conversation, whereas "with" would imply a collaboration or joint action.

2. Error: to, Correction: (no correction needed)

The error is the presence of the unnecessary word "to" in the phrase "all face their phones and do not talk with to other". The correct sentence should be "all face their phones and do not talk to other" without the extra "to". This correction removes the redundancy and makes the sentence more concise and clear.
cleaned: 1. Error: with, Correction: to
Label: 1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.




Error_sentence: That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
Correct_sentence: That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
Prediction: Based on the given information, here is a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: "elements" instead of "element"

Explanation: The error is a plural noun ("elements") used instead of the singular noun ("element") that is required in this context. The word "element" refers to a single essential factor, whereas "elements" would imply multiple factors.
cleaned: 1. Error: "elements" instead of "element"
Label: 1. The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.




Error_sentence: Since this is happen more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to .
Correct_sentence: Since this happens more often in countries which are much larger than Singapore , it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child without knowing where the child has been brought to .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: is happen, Correction: happens
The error is a verb tense inconsistency. "Happen" should be used as a verb, not as a linking verb "to be". The correct sentence should use the present simple tense "happens" instead of the incorrect "is happen".

2. Error: the, Correction: 
The error is a missing article. The sentence should have the definite article "the" before "countries" to indicate that it is referring to a specific group of countries.

3. Error: country, Correction: countries
The error is a singular noun used in a plural context. The sentence is talking about multiple countries, so it should use the plural form "countries" instead of the singular form "country".

4. Error: is, Correction: are
The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The subject of the sentence is "which are much larger than Singapore", which is a plural noun phrase, so the verb "are" should be used instead of the singular "is".

5. Error: back, Correction: 
The error is an unnecessary word. The sentence already conveys the idea of searching for the child, and the word "back" is not necessary.
cleaned: 1. Error: is happen, Correction: happens
Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.




Error_sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenges for the innovators .
Correct_sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenge for the innovators .
Prediction: Based on the given erroneous sentence and its correction, along with the explicit errors, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: challenges -> challenge

Explanation: In the erroneous sentence, "challenges" is a plural noun, whereas in the correct sentence, it should be a singular noun "challenge". The error is likely due to the incorrect assumption that "challenges" is the correct form, when in fact, the intended meaning is a single challenge, not multiple challenges.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The pronoun "another" means "one more," so it is singular and cannot be used with the plural "challenges." The singular "challenge" should be used instead.




Error_sentence: In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
Correct_sentence: In addition , privacy issues have become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share in the first place .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: issue, Correction: issues
The error is a singular noun error. The word "issue" is a singular noun, but in this context, it should be a plural noun because "issues" is the correct form when referring to multiple privacy concerns or problems. The correction is necessary to maintain grammatical accuracy and consistency.

2. Error: has, Correction: have
The error is a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "privacy issues", which is a plural noun, but the verb "has" is a singular verb. The correction is necessary because the subject-verb agreement rule states that a plural subject requires a plural verb. In this case, the correct verb is "have", which is the plural form of the verb "to be".

3. Error: at, Correction: in
The error is a preposition error. The word "at" is not the correct preposition to use in this context. The phrase "in the first place" is an idiomatic expression that means "initially" or "originally", and the correct preposition to use is "in", not "at". The correction is necessary to maintain the intended meaning and idiomatic expression in the
cleaned: 1. Error: issue, Correction: issues
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about privacy issues in general, so "issue" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Privacy issues" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
3. Incorrect word. The correct expression is "in the first place".




Error_sentence: This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .
Correct_sentence: This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both at high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: has, Correction: have

The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The subject of the sentence is "his parents", which is a plural noun, so the verb "have" should be used instead of "has", which is a singular verb form.

2. Error: under, Correction: at

The error is a preposition mistake. In this context, "at" is the correct preposition to use to indicate a risk or a condition, whereas "under" is not idiomatic in this phrase. "At high risk" is a common expression to describe the likelihood of something happening.

3. Error: under, Correction: at

This error is the same as the previous one. The correct preposition to use in this context is "at", not "under".

4. Error: runing, Correction: running

The error is a spelling mistake. The correct spelling of the verb "to run" is "running", not "runing". This verb is in the present participle form, indicating an action that is ongoing or in progress.
cleaned: 1. Error: has, Correction: have
Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.




Error_sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Correct_sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Prediction: Based on the given information, here is a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error:  (comma) -> Correction: the

Explanation: The error is a missing article ("the") before the noun "next generation". The correct sentence should have the article "the" to provide clarity and specificity. The sentence is trying to refer to a specific generation, and the article "the" helps to identify which generation is being referred to.
cleaned: 1. Error:  (comma) -> Correction: the
Label: 1. Missing article. As you are talking specifically about the next generation, use the definite article, "the".




Error_sentence: The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people .
Correct_sentence: The social network may also creat some negative impacts for people .
Prediction: Based on the given information, I will provide a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.

Error 1:
Error: the
Correction: (no correction needed)

Explanation: The word "the" is not an error in this sentence. It is a definite article used to refer to a specific social network.

Error 2:
Error: creat
Correction: create

Explanation: The word "creat" is a typo and should be corrected to "create", which is the correct verb form in this sentence.

So, the only error in the erroneous sentence is the typo "creat" which should be corrected to "create".
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The concept of "people" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of people instead of to people in general.




Error_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
Correct_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: shall, Correction: should

The error is a mistake in the verb tense. "Shall" is a formal, archaic way of expressing future tense, whereas "should" is a more modern and commonly used way to express obligation or recommendation. In this sentence, "should not" is the correct way to express the idea that RFID technology should not be easily available.

2. Error: for, Correction: to

The error is a mistake in the preposition used. "For" is often used to indicate purpose or intention, whereas "to" is used to indicate direction or movement. In this sentence, "to" is the correct preposition to use because it indicates that the public should not be able to access the RFID technology.

3. Error: and, Correction: or

The error is a mistake in the conjunction used. "And" is often used to connect two things, whereas "or" is used to indicate a choice between two things. In this sentence, "or" is the correct conjunction to use because it indicates that the public should not be able to access the RFID technology in either of two ways (taken for granted or easily available).
cleaned: 1. Error: shall, Correction: should
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.




Error_sentence: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Correct_sentence: In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees to spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error:  (no correction needed) -> Explanation: This is not an error, it's a comma (,) which is a necessary punctuation mark to separate items in a list or to set off nonessential clauses. The correction "the" is actually for the error in the next item.

2. Error: network, Correction: networks -> Explanation: The error is that the singular noun "network" should be changed to the plural noun "networks" to agree with the plural subject "employers" and to accurately describe the multiple social media platforms being blocked.

3. Error: spend, Correction: spending -> Explanation: The error is that the verb "spend" is in the simple present tense, which implies a single action, whereas the context suggests that the employees are engaging in leisure activities during office hours, which is a continuous or ongoing action. The correction "spending" changes the verb to the present participle, indicating a continuous or ongoing action, which fits better with the context.
cleaned: 1. Error:  (no correction needed) -> Explanation: This is not an error, it's a comma (,) which is a necessary punctuation mark to separate items in a list or to set off nonessential clauses. The correction "the" is actually for the error in the next item.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."




Error_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .
Correct_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used on the social media sites .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "of" instead of "the"

The error is using the preposition "of" instead of the definite article "the" before the noun "writing skills". In this context, "the writing skills" refers to a specific set of skills, so the correct article to use is "the", not "of". "Of" is typically used to indicate possession or origin, whereas "the" is used to indicate a specific, previously mentioned noun.

2. Error: "in" instead of "on"

The error is using the preposition "in" instead of "on" before the phrase "social media sites". In this context, "on" is the correct preposition to use because it indicates the relationship between the time used and the social media sites, implying that the time is being spent using the sites, rather than being part of the sites themselves. "In" would imply that the time is being spent within the sites, which is not the intended meaning.
cleaned: 1. Error: "of" instead of "the"
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Error_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Correct_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .
Prediction: Based on the given information, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.

Error 1: "despite of the distance" -> "despite the distance"

Explanation: The error is the use of the preposition "of" instead of the correct preposition "the". In this context, "despite" is followed by a noun phrase ("the distance"), so the correct preposition to use is "the", not "of".
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. If you were using "in spite" it would be okay to write "in spite of the distance", but "of" is not necessary when using "despite".




Error_sentence: Therefore , the social media is truly good for people .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , social media is truly good for people .
Prediction: A nice exercise!

Error 1: the, Correction: (none)

Explanation: The error is the unnecessary article "the" before the noun "social media". In English, we don't use articles ("the", "a", "an") before common nouns when they refer to general categories or concepts. "Social media" is a general term, so it doesn't need an article.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.




Error_sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Correct_sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal moral morals the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

**Error 1: "moral" -> "morals"**

The error is a simple typo. The correct word is "morals", which is a plural noun, whereas "moral" is a singular noun. In this context, the sentence needs to use "morals" to indicate multiple moral principles or values that affect the decision.

**Error 2: "the" -> "" (no correction needed)**

This is not an error at all! The sentence is correct as it is. There is no missing or extra word "the" in the original sentence. The corrected sentence is identical to the original sentence, except for the correction of "moral" to "morals".
cleaned: 
Label: 1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."




Error_sentence: For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Correct_sentence: For example , we tend send birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Prediction: Here is the explanation for each error:

1. Error: a, Correction: (no correction needed)

Explanation: The error is the absence of a word, but the correction is actually the same sentence. It seems that there was no actual error in the original sentence.
cleaned: 1. Error: a, Correction: (no correction needed)
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "birthday wishes." Either "birthday wishes" or "a birthday wish" would be acceptable.




Error_sentence: It means that one can not know another 's real thought and personalities by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
Correct_sentence: It means that one can not know another 's real thoughts and personality by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: thought, Correction: thoughts

The error is a pluralization mistake. The word "thought" is singular, but the subject "one" is referring to multiple thoughts that cannot be known. The correction "thoughts" makes the sentence grammatically correct and accurately conveys the idea that multiple thoughts cannot be known.

2. Error: personalities, Correction: personality

The error is a pluralization mistake. The word "personalities" is plural, but the subject "one" is referring to a single personality that cannot be known. The correction "personality" makes the sentence grammatically correct and accurately conveys the idea that a single personality cannot be known.
cleaned: 1. Error: thought, Correction: thoughts
Label: 1. The singular noun "thought" refers to a single idea or opinion. For example, "I think I'd like eggs for breakfast" or "She thinks it would be fun to try beekeeping" are two thoughts. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "thoughts" should be pluralized.
2. The singular noun "personality" means a collection of traits, behaviors, or emotional qualities that make up an individual's character. The plural noun "personalities" refers to the personalities of multiple people.




Error_sentence: These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Correct_sentence: These social media makes people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: "life" instead of "lives"

The error is a singular noun ("life") used in a plural context. In the sentence, "people" is a plural noun, and it's describing the lives of those people, so the correct word to use is the plural form "lives".
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The sentence mentions multiple people, so "life" should be pluralised, as there are multiple lives.




Error_sentence: One can not truly understand a person with only stalking his/her facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present .
Correct_sentence: One can not truly understand a person by only stalking his/her facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present .
Prediction: Here is the explanation for each error:

1. Error: "with" instead of "by"
Explanation: The error is a preposition mismatch. "With" is used to indicate association or accompaniment, whereas "by" is used to indicate the means or method by which something is done. In this sentence, "by" is the correct preposition to use because it indicates that the person understands the person being stalked through the act of stalking their Facebook page, rather than being associated with them through some other means.
cleaned: 1. Error: "with" instead of "by"
Label: 1. This sentence is saying that one cannot understand a person "through the means of" stalking their Facebook page, and so you need to use "by" here to express the same meaning. It is being used in the same way as "He came by train".




Error_sentence: Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed .
Correct_sentence: Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make the right decision after they have be informed .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: a, Correction: the

The error is a missing article ("the") before the noun "right decision". The correct sentence uses the definite article "the" to indicate that a specific decision is being referred to, whereas the erroneous sentence uses the indefinite article "a", which would suggest a general or unspecified decision.
cleaned: 1. Error: a, Correction: the
Label: 1. The sentence is mentioning one specific decision, i.e., the correct one, so use the definite article, "the".




Error_sentence: In conclusion , social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationship and make new friends , as well as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
Correct_sentence: In conclusion , social media in contemporary society is able to help one improve relationships and make new friends , as well as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: the, Correction: (no correction needed)

Explanation: The word "the" is not present in the correct sentence, which means it was not necessary in the original sentence either. The correct sentence starts with "In contemporary society", so there is no need for the definite article "the".

2. Error: relationship, Correction: relationships

Explanation: The word "relationship" is singular, referring to one specific relationship. However, the correct sentence uses the plural form "relationships", indicating multiple relationships. This change is necessary to match the context of social media helping people improve their relationships with others.
cleaned: 1. Error: the, Correction: (no correction needed)
Label: 1. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.
2. When referencing relationships as a general concept, the plural "relationships" should be used because it references multiple relationships between many different people. The singular "relationship" is used to refer to individual relationships, with "a relationship" meaning any relationship and "the relationship" meaning one relationship specifically.




Error_sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about others .
Correct_sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has knowledge about others .
Prediction: Here's the explanation for each error:

1. Error: a, Correction: none

Explanation: There is no error "a" in the original sentence. It's possible that the error is not explicitly listed or is not an error at all. The correct sentence has no "a" that needs to be corrected.

The actual error is the word "concurrently" which should be "knows" instead.
cleaned: 1. Error: a, Correction: none
Label: 1. "Knowledge" is an uncountable and abstract noun, so it cannot be made singular or plural, thus it cannot be used with the indefinite article 'a.'




Error_sentence: On one side , it is obvioualy that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Correct_sentence: On one side , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Prediction: Here is the explanation for each error:

1. Error: "obvioualy" instead of "obvious"

The error is a typo, where the writer accidentally added the suffix "-ly" to the word "obvious", making it "obvioualy". The correct word is simply "obvious", which means clearly or plainly visible or understandable.
cleaned: 1. Error: "obvioualy" instead of "obvious"
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "obvious." Also, it looks like the author intended to use the word "obviously," which is an adverb. Adverbs are used to modify verbs, but in this sentence, the word follows "it is" and therefore should be a noun.




Error_sentence: Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
Correct_sentence: Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
Prediction: Here is a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: do, Correction: does

The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The subject of the sentence is "social media", which is a singular noun, and therefore the verb "create" should be in the singular form "does" instead of "do", which is a plural verb form. In the corrected sentence, "does" agrees with the singular subject "social media" and maintains the sentence's grammatical correctness.
cleaned: 1. Error: do, Correction: does
Label: 1. The subject here is "social media," which is collective and treated as singular, so the verb should be "does" for subject verb agreement.




Error_sentence: Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .
Correct_sentence: Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or afraid of .
Prediction: Based on the given information, I'll provide the explanations for each error:

1. Error: be, Correction: 

Explanation: The error is the repetition of the word "be" in the erroneous sentence. The correct sentence only needs one instance of "be" to form a grammatically correct sentence. The word "be" is a linking verb that connects the subject to the predicate, and in this case, it's used to form a passive construction. Therefore, the corrected sentence is "Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or afraid of."
cleaned: 1. Error: be, Correction:
Label: 1. The first "be" in the sentence can be used for both "shy" and "afraid", you do not need to repeat it for "afraid".




Error_sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Correct_sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .
Prediction: Here is a simple explanation for each error:

1. Error: "but" instead of "and"

The erroneous sentence uses the word "but" to connect the two clauses, which is incorrect. "But" is a coordinating conjunction that introduces a contrast or contradiction, whereas "and" is a coordinating conjunction that joins two equal clauses. In this sentence, the two clauses are not contrasting, but rather, they are describing a sequence of events. Therefore, the correct word to use is "and", which indicates a continuation or addition.
cleaned: 1. Error: "but" instead of "and"
Label: 1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.




Error_sentence: If China can come up with effective policy to change its education system and stimulate innovation , China 's pace to flourish may become even faster .
Correct_sentence: If China can come up with an effective policy to change its education system and stimulate innovation , China 's pace to flourish may become even faster .
Prediction: Based on the given information, I can provide the following explanation for the error:

Error 1: The erroneous sentence contains a comma (,) before the word "an", whereas the correct sentence has the word "an" without the comma.

Explanation: The error is likely due to a misplaced comma, which is not necessary in this context. The word "an" is a definite article used to modify a singular noun, and it should be written without a comma. The correct sentence uses "an" correctly, without the unnecessary comma.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The noun "policy" requires either an article or pluralization. The definite article "the" refers to a specific policy, especially one that was mentioned earlier in the text. Because no such policy was mentioned, it should be changed to the indefinite article "a," which refers to one single unspecified policy out of multiple potential policies, or alternately to the plural "policies," which means multiple unspecified policies.




Error_sentence: In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Correct_sentence: In past decades , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: the, Correction: 
Explanation: The error is a missing article "past" instead of "the" in the phrase "In the past decades". The correct sentence uses the correct article "past" to modify the noun "decades", indicating a specific time period in the past.

2. Error: are, Correction: were
Explanation: The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The subject "sites" is a plural noun, but the verb "were" is the correct form of the verb "to be" in the past tense, indicating a completed action. The incorrect verb "are" is the present tense form, which doesn't match the subject.

3. Error: connect, Correction: connected
Explanation: The error is a tense inconsistency. The sentence is describing a past event, so the verb "connected" should be used in the past tense. The incorrect verb "connect" is in the present tense, which doesn't match the context of the sentence.

4. Error: live, Correction: lived
Explanation: The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The subject "others" is a plural noun, but the verb "lived" is the correct form of the verb
cleaned: 1. Error: the, Correction:
Label: 1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."




Error_sentence: And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
Correct_sentence: And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering genes is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

**Error 1: "gene" -> "genes"**

The error is a simple typo. The correct word is "genes", which is the plural form of "gene", referring to multiple genetic units. In the context of genetic engineering and gene editing, it is common to refer to multiple genes being altered or edited.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The technology to alter genetic material could be applied not just to a single gene but any and all genes. For that reason, it's correct to use the plural "genes" rather than the singular "gene."




Error_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement .
Correct_sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to high-velocity technological advancement .
Prediction: Based on the input, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: the -> 

Explanation: The error is the unnecessary article "the" before the phrase "high-velocity technological advancement". The article "the" is not needed because "high-velocity technological advancement" is a unique concept and not a specific, previously mentioned one.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The concept of "technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific advancement instead of the progress of technology in general.




Error_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .
Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: the, Correction: 

The error is a plural noun error. In the original sentence, "contacts" is a plural noun, but the correction is a singular noun "contact". This is because "contact" is being used as a countable noun in this context, referring to a single instance of human interaction.

2. Error: contacts, Correction: contact

The error is a verb agreement error. The verb "has decresed" is not agreeing with the subject "the importance of face-to-face human contact", which is a singular noun. The correction is to change the verb to "has decreased", which agrees with the singular subject.
cleaned: 1. Error: the, Correction:
Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.




Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

**Error 1: Researches, Correction: Research**

The error is the plural form "Researches" instead of the singular form "Research". In English, when referring to a general study or investigation, the correct form is the singular "Research", not the plural "Researches". This is because a research is a single, comprehensive study, not multiple studies.

**Error 2: show, Correction: shows**

The error is the incorrect verb tense "show" instead of the correct verb tense "shows". In the sentence, the subject is "Research", which is a singular noun, and the verb should agree with it. Since "Research" is a singular subject, the verb "shows" (in the third person singular present tense) is the correct choice, not the verb "show" (which is the base form of the verb).
cleaned: 
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.




Error_sentence: Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Correct_sentence: Writing is an essential skill for person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Prediction: Based on the given erroneous sentence and its correction, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: "of" instead of "for"
Explanation: The error is due to a mistake in the preposition used. In this context, "for" is the correct preposition to use because it indicates the purpose or intended use of writing, whereas "of" is a possessive preposition that would imply ownership or relationship. For example, "the book of poetry" implies that the book belongs to poetry, whereas "the skill for writing" indicates that writing is the intended use of the skill.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the skill of writing) with regard to whom (a person).




Error_sentence: While we do know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
Correct_sentence: While we do know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

**Error 1: "them" -> "against"**

The original sentence uses the preposition "them" instead of the correct preposition "against". In this context, "against" is the correct choice because it indicates the direction or target of the discrimination, whereas "them" would imply the people being discriminated against.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."




Error_sentence: And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life , products such as RFID tracking system have become real .
Correct_sentence: And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life . Products such as RFID tracking systems have become real .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

**Error 1: , products -> . Products**

The error is a comma splice, where a comma is used to separate two independent clauses that should be separated by a period (.) and a capital letter. In this case, "And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life" is a complete sentence, and "products such as RFID tracking system have become real" is another complete sentence. The correct way to separate them is with a period and a capital letter, making "Products" the first word of the new sentence.

**Error 2: system -> systems**

The error is a singular noun error, where the singular noun "system" is incorrectly used instead of the plural noun "systems". The phrase "products such as RFID tracking system" implies a collection of systems, so the correct noun form is "systems" to agree with the plural noun "products".
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Use a full stop to separate these two sentences.
2. The sentence is talking about systems in general, so "system" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem .
Correct_sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately becomes really a big problem .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: become, Correction: becomes

The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. In the sentence, the subject is "expressing themselves appropriately", which is a singular noun phrase. The verb "become" is a singular verb that agrees with the subject, but it should be changed to the plural verb "becomes" to maintain subject-verb agreement.
cleaned: 1. Error: become, Correction: becomes
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. "Expressing themselves" is the third person singular, so use "becomes" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: More and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life .
Correct_sentence: More and more networking has been transferred to the internet from real life .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: The erroneous input sentence lacks the definite article "the" before the noun "internet". The correct sentence includes the article "the" to indicate that it is a specific, well-known internet, rather than just any internet.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Error_sentence: With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life .
Correct_sentence: With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each other through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important role in our life .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "others" instead of "other"
Explanation: The error is due to a plural form being used instead of a singular form. In this sentence, "each other" is a reflexive pronoun that requires the singular form "other" to agree with the subject "they". Using the plural form "others" disrupts the grammatical agreement and makes the sentence sound unnatural.

2. Error: "aspect" instead of "role"
Explanation: The error is due to a misuse of words with similar meanings. While both "aspect" and "role" can refer to a part or a function, they have distinct connotations. In this sentence, "role" is the correct choice because it implies a more significant and active part that "face-to-face human interaction" plays in one's life. "Aspect" would imply a more superficial or incidental feature, which is not the intended meaning.
cleaned: 1. Error: "others" instead of "other"
Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".




Error_sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
Correct_sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows .
Prediction: Here is the explanation for each error:

1. Error: the, Correction: (no change)

Explanation: The error is the unnecessary use of the definite article "the" before the noun "society". The correct sentence uses the noun "society" without the article, as it is a common noun referring to a general concept, not a specific one.
cleaned: 1. Error: the, Correction: (no change)
Label: 1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society, instead of the concept in general.




Error_sentence: Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue .
Correct_sentence: Here I want to share Forest 's view on this issue .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: Forest'view
Explanation: The error is a typo, where the apostrophe (') is used incorrectly. The correct usage of an apostrophe is to indicate possession or to form a contraction. In this case, the correct usage would be to use an apostrophe to indicate possession, making "Forest's" the correct phrase. The single quote (') is used to indicate a contraction, which is not the intended meaning here.
cleaned: 1. Error: Forest'view
Label: 1. An "s" and a space are missing. There should be an "s" after the apostrophe and "view" should be a separate word.




Error_sentence: People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
Correct_sentence: People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: length, Correction: lengths

The error is a singular noun ("length") used in a plural context ("to great length[s]"), which is incorrect. In this sentence, "lengths" is the correct plural form of "length" because it is referring to multiple lengths or distances.
cleaned: 1. Error: length, Correction: lengths
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".




Error_sentence: Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .
Correct_sentence: Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: dignosis, Correction: diagnosis

The error is a simple spelling mistake. The correct word is "diagnosis", which refers to the process of identifying the nature of a disease or condition, whereas "dignosis" is not a valid word. The correction is straightforward, replacing the incorrect spelling with the correct one.

2. Error: Seconly, Correction: Secondly

The error is another spelling mistake. The correct word is "Secondly", which is an adverb meaning "in the second place" or "next in order". The incorrect spelling "Seconly" is likely a typo or a mistake in typing. The correction is to replace the incorrect spelling with the correct one, ensuring that the sentence is grammatically and linguistically accurate.
cleaned: 1. Error: dignosis, Correction: diagnosis
Label: 1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "diagnosis".
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "Secondly".




Error_sentence: Serendipity is usually defined as a discovery under an accidental case , and it often results the invention of a new technology .
Correct_sentence: Serendipity is usually defined as the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery , and it often results in the invention of a new technology .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "a discovery under an accidental case" instead of "the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery"

Explanation: The original sentence is using a phrase that is not grammatically correct and does not accurately convey the meaning of serendipity. The correct phrase "the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery" is a more precise and idiomatic way to describe the concept of serendipity. The error is likely due to a misunderstanding of the term "serendipity" or a lack of clarity in the original sentence.

2. Error: ", " instead of "in"

Explanation: The error is a simple punctuation mistake, where a comma (",") is used instead of the preposition "in". The correct sentence uses "in" to indicate the relationship between the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery and the invention of a new technology. The comma was likely used to separate two independent clauses, but it disrupts the flow and clarity of the sentence.
cleaned: 1. Error: "a discovery under an accidental case" instead of "the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery"
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.




Error_sentence: The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .
Correct_sentence: The earlier we tell them , the better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .
Prediction: Based on the input, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error:

**Error 1:** "a" instead of "the"

**Explanation:** The error is a missing article ("the") before the adjective "better". In the corrected sentence, "the" is used to indicate which "better" is being referred to, making the sentence more specific and clear. Without "the", the sentence is ambiguous and lacks precision.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The construction "the earlier A, the better B" is talking about specifics, with a greater focus on B. As such, B requires an article, and as you are talking about something specific, you should use the definite article, "the".




Error_sentence: As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Correct_sentence: As a result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Prediction: Here is the explanation for the error:

Error 1: the -> a

The error is a mistake in the use of articles. "The" is a definite article, which is used to refer to a specific, previously mentioned noun. In this case, there is no specific "result" mentioned before, so "the" is incorrect. The correct article to use is "a", which is an indefinite article, indicating that the result is a general or unspecified one.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "As the result" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a result," which implies that the outcome is one of several.




Error_sentence: More supports must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of such junction whether should him/her to inform the relatives .
Correct_sentence: More support must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of such junction whether should him/her to inform the relatives .
Prediction: Based on the given information, here's a simple explanation for each error:

1. Error: supports, Correction: support

The error is a plural form "supports" instead of the singular form "support". In the sentence, "support" is a noun that refers to a single instance of assistance or help, so the correct form is "support" rather than "supports".
cleaned: 1. Error: supports, Correction: support
Label: 1. In the context of care and aid from other people, the word "support" is an uncountable noun and is not pluralized. It generally refers to actions or gestures, which are not tangible and cannot be counted. The word "supports" is a verb form or a noun referring to the structural components of a building that allow it to withstand force.




Error_sentence: Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Correct_sentence: Also , according to research , it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: a, Correction: 
Explanation: The error is the use of the indefinite article "a" before the noun "research". Since "research" is a singular noun, the correct article to use is the definite article "the".

2. Error: the, Correction: 
Explanation: The error is the use of the definite article "the" before the proper noun "Facebook". Since "Facebook" is a proper noun, it should not be preceded by an article.

3. Error: the, Correction: 
Explanation: There is no error here. The sentence already has the correct definite article "the" before the noun "people".
cleaned: 1. Error: a, Correction:
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. This sentence is talking about users in general and therefore should not have an article.
3. "Facebook" is a proper noun and therefore should not have an article.




Error_sentence: As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
Correct_sentence: As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk of have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: "to" -> "of"

The original sentence says "at risk to have it", which is incorrect. The correct phrase should be "at risk of having it". The word "to" is often used to indicate movement or direction, whereas "of" is used to indicate possession or a relationship. In this context, "of" is the correct preposition to use, as it indicates the risk that the family member is at of having the genetic disorder.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. As "risk" is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".




Error_sentence: Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet .
Correct_sentence: Not only the phone do the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computers , laptops , tablets , and many other devices which are able to connect to the internet .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: computer, Correction: computers
The error is a singular noun error. The correct form is "computers" because it is a plural noun referring to multiple devices.

2. Error: laptop, Correction: laptops
The error is a singular noun error. The correct form is "laptops" because it is a plural noun referring to multiple devices.

3. Error: tablet, Correction: tablets
The error is a singular noun error. The correct form is "tablets" because it is a plural noun referring to multiple devices.

4. Error: , Correction: the
The error is a missing article error. The correct sentence needs the article "the" before "internet" to make it grammatically correct.

5. Error: did, Correction: do
The error is a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "phone", which is a singular noun, so the correct verb form is "do" instead of "did".
cleaned: 1. Error: computer, Correction: computers
Label: 1. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and "the computer" meaning one computer specifically.
2. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing laptops as a general concept, the plural "laptops" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "laptop" is used to refer to an individual laptop, with "a laptop" meaning any laptop and "the laptop" meaning one laptop specifically.
3. The plural noun "tablet" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing tablets as a general concept, the plural "tablets" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "tablet" is used to refer to an individual tablet, with "a tablet" meaning any tablet and "the tablet" meaning one tablet specifically.
4. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.
5. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "did" implies that the phone is no longer involved in people's work, so it should be the present tense "do" instead.




Error_sentence: Another problem with social media is that , the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not relfected as something positive to the users .
Correct_sentence: Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not reflected as something positive to the users .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: ,, Correction: .

Explanation: The error is an unnecessary comma (",") between "that" and "the". This comma is not needed and makes the sentence awkward to read. In the corrected sentence, the comma is removed, and the sentence flows smoothly.

2. Error: relfected, Correction: reflected

Explanation: The error is a misspelling of the word "reflected". The correct spelling is "reflected", which means to show or express something in a particular way. The misspelling "reflected" is likely due to a typing mistake or a lack of attention to detail.
cleaned: 1. Error: ,, Correction: .
Label: 1. Unnecessary comma. The position of the comma is grammatically incorrect.
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "reflected".




Error_sentence: I do not agree on this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Correct_sentence: I do not agree with this statement that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "on" instead of "with"

The error is a substitution of the preposition "on" with "with". The correct preposition "with" is used to indicate agreement or concurrence with a statement, whereas "on" is used to indicate a focus or emphasis on something. In this context, "with" is the correct choice because it indicates the speaker's agreement with the statement that follows.

2. Error: "argument" instead of "statement"

The error is a substitution of the noun "argument" with "statement". While both words can refer to a proposition or a claim, "argument" typically implies a more contentious or disputable claim, whereas "statement" is a more general term for a declaration or assertion. In this context, the correct choice is "statement" because it is a neutral term that simply states a fact or opinion, without implying controversy or debate.
cleaned: 1. Error: "on" instead of "with"
Label: 1. If you "agree on" something it usually means you reach a compromise with someone. When talking about an opinion and saying whether you agree or disagree, "agree" is usually followed by the preposition "with".
2. Incorrect word choice. This is an opinion/assertion that is being stated, so use "statement".




Error_sentence: However , critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
Correct_sentence: However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: with, Correction: the

Explanation: The word "with" is not necessary in this sentence and disrupts the flow of ideas. The correct sentence uses the word "the" to refer to the existence of social media sites, making the sentence clearer and more concise.

2. Error: have, Correction: has

Explanation: The verb "have" is incorrect in this sentence because it is referring to a singular noun ("existence") and should therefore be replaced with the singular verb "has".
cleaned: 1. Error: with, Correction: the
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".




Error_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Correct_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "of" instead of "on"

The error is the use of the preposition "of" instead of "on". In this context, "on" is the correct preposition to use because it indicates the relationship between the society's reliance and social media. "Of" would imply possession or origin, which doesn't make sense in this sentence. The correct phrase "reliance on social media" means that the society relies on social media, whereas "reliance of social media" would imply that social media is the source of something.

2. Error: extra "the"

The error is the inclusion of an extra "the" in the sentence. The sentence already has one "the" before "social media", and another one is not needed. The extra "the" makes the sentence sound awkward and unnecessary. The correct sentence only needs one "the" to indicate the specific social media being referred to.
cleaned: 1. Error: "of" instead of "on"
Label: 1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.




Error_sentence: Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .
Correct_sentence: Social media provides people with a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .
Prediction: Based on the given information, I can provide a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.

Error 1: "a way of" instead of "with"
Explanation: The preposition "with" is used to indicate possession or association, whereas "a way of" is not a grammatically correct phrase in this context. In this sentence, "with" is used to indicate that social media provides people with a means of talking and chatting.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Missing word. Use "with" to link "provides" and "a way of talking and chatting" so we know what is being provided by social media.




Error_sentence: As we all know , the interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas .
Correct_sentence: As we all know , interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

1. Error: the, Correction: (none)

Explanation: The error is the presence of the definite article "the" before the noun "interpersonal skills". In this context, "interpersonal skills" is a singular noun, so it doesn't need the article "the". The correction is to remove the unnecessary article, making the sentence grammatically correct.
cleaned: 1. Error: the, Correction: (none)
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general and therefore should not have an article.




Error_sentence: Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Prediction: Based on the given information, here's a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: Error: , Correction: a

Explanation: The error is the absence of the indefinite article "a" before the noun "need". The correct sentence uses "a need" instead of just "need". This is because "need" is a singular noun and requires the indefinite article "a" to make sense.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need. There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.




Error_sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Correct_sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Prediction: Based on the given information, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence:

Error 1:
Erroneous sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Correction: the
Explanation: The error is the lack of the definite article "the" before the noun "time". In English, it is common to use the definite article "the" before a specific time period, such as "the time we spend away". Without the article, the sentence sounds incomplete and unclear.

In the corrected sentence, the addition of "the" before "time" makes the sentence more grammatically correct and easier to understand.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.




Error_sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than five percent of the population in the China .
Correct_sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than five percent of the population in China .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: lesser, Correction: less

The error is a mistake in the choice of comparative adverb. "Lesser" is used to compare quantities that are not divisible, whereas "less" is used to compare quantities that are divisible. In this sentence, "less" is the correct choice because it is comparing a percentage of the population, which is a divisible quantity. "Lesser" would be used if the sentence were comparing, for example, the size of two cities.

2. Error: the, Correction: (no correction needed)

The error is a mistake in the presence of an unnecessary word. The word "the" is not needed before "China" because it is a proper noun and does not require an article. The corrected sentence is grammatically correct and clear in its meaning.
cleaned: 1. Error: lesser, Correction: less
Label: 1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.




Error_sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Correct_sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Prediction: Here's the explanation for each error:

Error 1: The erroneous sentence has an extra comma (,) before the word "the". The correction is to remove this extra comma.

Explanation: In English grammar, commas are used to separate items in a list, to set off nonessential clauses, or to indicate a pause in the sentence. However, in this case, the comma before "the" is unnecessary and creates a slight pause in the sentence, making it sound awkward. Removing the extra comma makes the sentence flow better and easier to read.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Missing article. As our planet is a countable noun but also the only one we know of, we call it "the world".




Error_sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease .
Correct_sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance of carrying certain disease .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "to" instead of "of"

The erroneous sentence uses the preposition "to" in the phrase "high chance to carry", which is incorrect. The correct preposition to use in this context is "of". The phrase should read "high chance of carrying". This error is likely due to a mistake in preposition selection, where the speaker or writer is trying to express a relationship between the chance and the action of carrying, but is using the wrong word.

2. Error: "carry" instead of "carrying"

The erroneous sentence uses the verb "carry" in the phrase "high chance to carry certain disease", which is incorrect. The correct verb to use in this context is "carrying". The phrase should read "high chance of carrying certain disease". This error is likely due to a mistake in verb tense or form, where the speaker or writer is trying to express a general possibility or likelihood, but is using the wrong verb form.
cleaned: 1. Error: "to" instead of "of"
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.




Error_sentence: Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts .
Correct_sentence: Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotional thoughts .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: "emotinal" instead of "emotional"

The error is a typo, where the writer accidentally replaced the correct word "emotional" with a similar-sounding but incorrect word "emotinal". The correct word "emotional" refers to feelings or emotions, whereas "emotinal" is not a valid word.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. This is a typo. The correct spelling is "emotional."




Error_sentence: It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
Correct_sentence: It provides people with a more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
Prediction: Here is the explanation for the error:

Error 1: The erroneous sentence has "more convenient contact environment" instead of "a more convenient contact environment".

Explanation: The error is the lack of the indefinite article "a" before the noun "more convenient contact environment". In English, when we describe a singular noun with an adjective, we typically use the indefinite article "a" before it. In this case, "a more convenient contact environment" is the correct phrase, whereas "more convenient contact environment" is missing the indefinite article "a".
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is used when something exists in an unspecified manner or amount, or to express one out of multiple options. The phrase "convenient contact environment" means one potential environment out of many, with varying degrees of convenience. This condition is best expressed by the indefinite article "a."




Error_sentence: This essay will discuss about both the benefits and down sides of using social media in the contemporary society .
Correct_sentence: This essay will discuss both the benefits and down sides of using social media in contemporary society .
Prediction: Based on the given information, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: about, Correction: 

Explanation: The error "about" is unnecessary in this context. The phrase "about" is often used to introduce a topic or subject, but in this sentence, it's not necessary. The correct sentence uses the phrase "both the benefits and down sides" to directly describe the topic, making "about" redundant.

2. Error: the, Correction: 

Explanation: The error "the" is unnecessary in this context. The word "the" is an article that is used to modify nouns, but in this sentence, it's not necessary. The correct sentence uses the phrase "contemporary society" without the article "the", as it's a common noun that doesn't require modification.

So, the corrected sentence is: This essay will discuss both the benefits and down sides of using social media in contemporary society.
cleaned: 1. Error: about, Correction:
Label: 1. The verb "discuss" does not take the preposition "about." While "about" is used with similar verbs like "tell" or "talk," in the case of "discuss," the object simply comes directly after, with no need for a preposition.
2. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.




Error_sentence: Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .
Correct_sentence: Although surveillance technology is an issue in safeguarding human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: the, Correction: 

The error is a redundant article "the" before the noun "surveillance technology". The correct sentence uses the noun "surveillance technology" without the article "the" because it is a common noun and not a specific one.

2. Error: invading, Correction: safeguarding

The error is a mismatched verb. The original sentence uses the verb "invading", which means to enter or attack someone's territory, but it doesn't make sense in the context of surveillance technology and human privacy. The corrected sentence uses the verb "safeguarding", which means to protect or defend something, which is a more accurate description of the issue with surveillance technology.

3. Error: the, Correction: 

This error is similar to the first one. The redundant article "the" is removed from the corrected sentence, making it grammatically correct and concise.
cleaned: 1. Error: the, Correction:
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about surveillance technology in general and therefore does not need an article.
2. None
3. The sentence is discussing human privacy in general, so it does not require an article.




Error_sentence: Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Correct_sentence: Some genes will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: genetic, Correction: genes
Explanation: The error is a typo, where the word "genetic" is replaced with "gene". However, "genetic" is an adjective that describes something related to genes, whereas "gene" is a noun that refers to a unit of heredity. In this context, the correct word is "genes", which is the plural form of the noun.

2. Error: none (there is no error, the correction is for a typo "gene" -> "genes", which is already explained)

Note that there is no error in the sentence "some are on the contrary", the correction is only for the two typos mentioned.
cleaned: 1. Error: genetic, Correction: genes
Label: 1. The adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted.
2. The word "some" means an unspecified amount or a large amount. It is usually used with plural nouns. Also, it is unlikely that there is only one gene that can only be inherited by a specific gender, so logically it is more likely to be the plural.




Error_sentence: Many people says they will support the social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
Correct_sentence: Many people say they will support social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

**Error 1: says, Correction: say**

The error is a verb tense inconsistency. In the original sentence, "says" is in the third person singular present tense, while "they" is in the plural subject form. The correct verb form should be "say" to agree with the plural subject "they".

**Error 2: the, Correction:**

The error is a missing article. The sentence originally had an extra definite article "the" which is not necessary in this context. The correct sentence uses no article before "social media" because it is a common noun and not a specific, previously mentioned noun.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The subject here is the plural "people," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "say."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.




Error_sentence: As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
Correct_sentence: As time passes , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "passed" instead of "passes"

The error is a simple verb tense mistake. The verb "pass" should be in the present participle form "passes" to indicate an ongoing action, whereas "passed" is a past tense form. In this context, "As time passes" means that the action of time moving forward is happening continuously, whereas "As time passed" would imply that time has already moved forward in the past.
cleaned: 1. Error: "passed" instead of "passes"
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.




Error_sentence: In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
Correct_sentence: In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: skill, Correction: skills

The error is a pluralization mistake. The correct form of the noun "interpersonal" is "skills" because it is a plural noun referring to multiple skills or abilities. In the erroneous sentence, the singular form "skill" is used, which is incorrect.

2. Error: is, Correction: are

The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The subject of the sentence is "interpersonal skills", which is a plural noun. Therefore, the verb "are" should be used instead of "is" to agree with the subject. In the erroneous sentence, the singular verb "is" is used, which is incorrect.
cleaned: 1. Error: skill, Correction: skills
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Interpersonal skills" is the third person plural, so use "are" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: There are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages , however in real life , he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly .
Correct_sentence: There are many people on social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages , however in real life , he or she may not have jobs or live poorly .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: in, Correction: on
The error is the use of "in" instead of "on" before "social media". "In" implies a location within something, whereas "on" implies a relationship or connection with something. In this sentence, "on social media" means being a part of or using social media, whereas "in social media" doesn't make sense.

2. Error: the, Correction: 
The error is the unnecessary use of the definite article "the" before "real life". The sentence is already specific about the topic, so there's no need to specify which real life. The correction removes the unnecessary word, making the sentence more concise.

3. Error: image, Correction: images
The error is the singular noun "image" when the correct form is "images" to agree with the plural noun "many people". The correction changes the singular noun to the plural form, ensuring grammatical accuracy.

4. Error: in, Correction: on
This error is the same as error 1, where "in" is used instead of "on" before "real life". The correction is the same, changing "in" to "on" to ensure the correct relationship
cleaned: 1. Error: in, Correction: on
Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.




Error_sentence: The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him .
Correct_sentence: The medical treatment technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
Prediction: Based on the given erroneous sentence and its correction, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: "is" -> "was"
Explanation: The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. In the given sentence, the subject "technology" is a singular noun, but the verb "is" is in the present tense, which is incorrect. The correct verb "was" in the past tense agrees with the subject "technology" and indicates that the situation being described occurred in the past.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Talking about something that happened in the past, so use the past tense "was".




Error_sentence: Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for the society .
Correct_sentence: Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society .
Prediction: Based on the given erroneous sentence and its correction, I will provide a simple explanation for each error.

Error 1: the -> society

Explanation: The error is a missing article ("the") before the noun "society". The correct sentence uses the definite article "the" to refer to a specific society, whereas the erroneous sentence omits it, making the sentence unclear and ambiguous.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific societies, instead of modern society in general.




Error_sentence: Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
Correct_sentence: Personally I am studying oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friends .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: study, Correction: studying

The error is a verb tense inconsistency. The sentence starts with "I am" in the present continuous tense, indicating an ongoing action. However, the verb "study" is in the simple present tense, which is inconsistent with the rest of the sentence. The correction "studying" maintains the present continuous tense, ensuring the sentence flows smoothly.

2. Error: in, Correction: (no correction needed)

The error is a mistaken insertion of the preposition "in". The original sentence "oversea" is likely a typo or a mistake, and the correct word is actually "abroad" or "overseas", which means "in a foreign country". Since the correction is not provided, it's unclear what the intended word was, but the error is likely a typo or a misunderstanding of the word's meaning.

3. Error: friend, Correction: friends

The error is a pluralization issue. The sentence is describing a group of friends, so the correct word is the plural form "friends", not the singular form "friend". The correction ensures that the sentence accurately conveys the intended meaning.
cleaned: 1. Error: study, Correction: studying
Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.




Error_sentence: Human has their own rights and privacy .
Correct_sentence: Humans have their own rights and privacy .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

**Error 1: Human, Correction: Humans**

The error is a singular noun error. The word "Human" is a singular noun, but it should be plural because it is the subject of the sentence and is being used to refer to multiple individuals. The corrected word "Humans" is the plural form of the noun, making the sentence grammatically correct.

**Error 2: has, Correction: have**

The error is a subject-verb agreement error. The subject of the sentence is "Humans", which is a plural noun. The verb "has" is a singular verb, which does not agree with the plural subject. The corrected verb "have" is a plural verb that agrees with the subject "Humans".
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".




Error_sentence: He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet .
Correct_sentence: He can even talk to his daughter face-to-face using video call via the internet .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

**Error 1:**
The erroneous sentence has "via internet" instead of "via the internet". The correct phrase should include the definite article "the" to specify which internet is being referred to. Without the article, the phrase sounds incomplete and informal.

**Error 2:**
The erroneous sentence has "her" instead of "his". The subject of the sentence is "He", which is a male pronoun, so the correct possessive adjective should be "his" to describe his daughter, rather than "her" which would imply a female daughter.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Missing article. "Internet" is the name of a specific network, so use the definite article, "the".
2. The sentence starts with "He", referring to man, but the third person possessive you have used is the female version. Change to "his" to match with "He" and make it clear that you are talking about a man.




Error_sentence: There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Correct_sentence: There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Prediction: Here is the explanation for each error:

**Error 1: for, Correction:**

The error is the unnecessary word "out" which is added before "attention". The correct sentence should simply be "seeking attention" without the preposition "out". This error is likely due to a misplacement of words or a misunderstanding of the intended meaning.

In the corrected sentence, "seeking attention" is a correct idiomatic expression that means to deliberately draw attention to oneself. The word "out" is not necessary in this context and can be removed to improve the sentence's clarity and concision.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Seek out" does not require the preposition "for" to indicate what is being sought out.




Error_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Correct_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Prediction: Here is a simple explanation for each error:

**Error 1: claimed -> claim**

The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. In the sentence, the subject is "Many of the teenagers today", which is a plural noun. The verb "claimed" is in the singular form, which doesn't agree with the plural subject. The corrected verb "claim" is in the plural form, which agrees with the subject.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.




Error_sentence: These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones .
Correct_sentence: These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: comes, Correction: come

The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The subject of the sentence is "advantages", which is a plural noun, and therefore the verb "come" should be used in the plural form "come" instead of the singular form "comes".

2. Error: application, Correction: applications

The error is a pluralization mistake. The noun "application" refers to a single instance of a software program, but in this context, it is referring to multiple instances of software programs. Therefore, the correct form is the plural form "applications".

3. Error: in, Correction: on

The error is a preposition mistake. The phrase "on our smartphones" is used to indicate that the mobile applications are available on the smartphones, whereas "in our smartphones" would imply that the applications are inside the smartphones, which is not the intended meaning. The correct preposition "on" is used to indicate the relationship between the applications and the smartphones.
cleaned: 1. Error: comes, Correction: come
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "come" to go with "advantages".
2. The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.
3. We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".




Error_sentence: Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
Correct_sentence: Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional checks or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: check, Correction: checks

The error is a singular noun ("check") used in a plural context. In the sentence, the intended meaning is that people would do multiple checks or take multiple medicines to prevent the disease, so the correct word is the plural form "checks".
cleaned: 1. Error: check, Correction: checks
Label: 1. From the sentence we can surmise that the people would have more than one check, so the plural "checks" should be used.




Error_sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Correct_sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spending too much time on the internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: spend, Correction: spending

The error is a verb tense inconsistency. The sentence starts with "In conclusion", which implies a sense of finality and completion. However, the verb "spend" is in the present tense, which doesn't match the formal tone and completed thought implied by the phrase "In conclusion". Changing "spend" to "spending" corrects the verb tense to the present participle, which is more suitable for the sentence.

2. Error:  , Correction: the

The error is a missing article. The sentence is describing a specific online environment, and the word "internet" should be preceded by the definite article "the" to indicate that it's a specific, previously mentioned online environment. Without the article, the sentence sounds incomplete and unclear. Adding "the" before "internet" clarifies the meaning and improves the sentence's coherence.
cleaned: 1. Error: spend, Correction: spending
Label: 1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.




Error_sentence: Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .
Correct_sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: Engineering, Correction: The engineering

The error is that the sentence starts with "Engineering" instead of "The engineering". This is likely because "Engineering" is a noun and should be preceded by the definite article "The" to indicate that it is a specific field of engineering being referred to.

2. Error: fused, Correction: by

The error is that the word "fused" is used instead of "by". "Fused" is a verb that means to join or merge two things together, whereas "by" is a preposition that indicates agency or means. In this context, "by" is the correct word to use to indicate that the engineers are the ones who are responsible for developing the system.

3. Error: on, Correction: to

The error is that the word "on" is used instead of "to". "On" is a preposition that typically indicates a position or a surface, whereas "to" is a preposition that indicates direction or purpose. In this context, "to" is the correct word to use to indicate the purpose of developing the system, which is to cater to desired deeds.

4. Error: desired deeds, Correction: (no correction
cleaned: 1. Error: Engineering, Correction: The engineering
Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."




Error_sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
Correct_sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger ?
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

**Error 1: get, Correction: put**

The original sentence uses the verb "get" incorrectly. The correct verb to use in this context is "put", which means to place or put someone or something in a certain situation or condition. In this sentence, the speaker is expressing concern that revealing one's true identity could put their loved ones in danger, rather than getting them in danger. "Get" implies a more active or intentional action, whereas "put" implies a more passive or unintended consequence.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The phrase "put in danger" is a common expression and the verb does not change. The verb "put" means to cause someone to be in a particular place or position.




Error_sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people .
Correct_sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
Prediction: Here's the explanation for the error:

Error 1: "lost" instead of "loss"

The error is a result of a common grammatical mistake. The word "lost" is a verb that means to misplace or be unable to find something, whereas "loss" is a noun that refers to the state of being without something or the result of something being taken away. In this context, the correct word is "loss", which refers to the loss of interpersonal skills. The subject-verb agreement and the context of the sentence make it clear that the correct word is "loss", not "lost".
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The verb "cause" is always followed by a noun, and "lost" is the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed to the noun "loss." 




Error_sentence: These green house gases are the main cause to worldwide global warming which give rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Correct_sentence: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "to" instead of "of"

The error is using the preposition "to" instead of the preposition "of" in the phrase "the main cause to worldwide global warming". The correct phrase should be "the main cause of worldwide global warming". The preposition "of" indicates possession or relationship, whereas "to" is used to indicate direction or movement. In this context, "of" is the correct choice because it shows the cause-and-effect relationship between the green house gases and global warming.

2. Error: "give" instead of "gives"

The error is using the verb "give" instead of the verb "gives" in the phrase "which give rise to further catastrophes". The correct phrase should be "which gives rise to further catastrophes". The verb "give" is in the base form, whereas "gives" is the third person singular present tense form of the verb "give". In this context, "gives" is the correct choice because it agrees with the subject "which" and indicates the action of giving rise to catastrophes.
cleaned: 1. Error: "to" instead of "of"
Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.




Error_sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
Correct_sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
Prediction: Based on the given erroneous sentence and its correction, I can provide the explanations for each error.

Error 1: "in" -> ""

Explanation: The error is the presence of an unnecessary word "in" after "keeping". The correct sentence removes this word to maintain the grammatical correctness and clarity of the sentence. The phrase "keeping confidential" is a correct and idiomatic way to express the idea of keeping something private or secret.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The statement is confusing two phrases: "keep confidential" and "in confidence." The phrase "keep confidential" is common and is used without variation in wording.




Error_sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have a unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage .
Correct_sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: a, Correction: an

The error is a mistake in the use of indefinite articles. In this case, "a" is used before a noun that starts with a vowel sound ("unhealthy"). The correct usage is to use "an" instead of "a" before a noun that starts with a vowel sound. This is because "an" is the indefinite article used before a noun that begins with a vowel sound or a silent letter.

2. Error: , Correction: the

The error is a mistake in the use of articles. In this case, a comma is used instead of the definite article "the" before the noun "end". The correct usage is to use "the" before a noun that refers to a specific, previously mentioned noun or a noun that is already known to the reader. In this sentence, "the end" refers to a specific end, so the correct usage is to use "the" instead of the comma.
cleaned: 1. Error: a, Correction: an
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".




Error_sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .
Correct_sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation , particularly small children who are studying in nursery .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: " , Correction: "

Explanation: The erroneous sentence has an extra comma after "situation". This comma is unnecessary and creates a pause that disrupts the flow of the sentence. The correct sentence omits this comma, making the sentence flow smoothly.

2. Error: "in particularly for", Correction: "particularly"

Explanation: The erroneous sentence has a phrase "in particularly for" which is incorrect. The correct sentence uses the adverb "particularly" to modify the noun "children", indicating that small children are being referred to. The phrase "in particularly for" is redundant and incorrect.

3. Error: "the", Correction: None (no correction needed)

Explanation: There is no error in the original sentence regarding the word "the". The word "the" is correctly used to modify the noun "students" and is not unnecessary or incorrect.
cleaned: 1. Error: " , Correction: "
Label: 1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.
2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own.
3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.




Error_sentence: According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .
Correct_sentence: According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes , which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Error 1: Error:  , Correction: ,

Explanation: The error is a comma (,) instead of a comma followed by a space (, ). The correct sentence requires a space after the comma to separate the two independent clauses. This is a common error in punctuation, where the writer forgets to add a space after the comma, making the sentence unclear and hard to read.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.




Error_sentence: Personally I feel more at ease on social medias .
Correct_sentence: Personally I feel more at ease on social media .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: medias -> media
The error is a plural form mistake. The correct word is "media", which is a singular noun referring to a medium of communication, such as television, radio, or the internet. The plural form of "media" is actually "media", not "medias".
cleaned: 
Label: 1. "Media" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralised.




Error_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .
Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: the, Correction: 

Explanation: The error is the unnecessary use of the definite article "the" before the noun "face-to-face human contacts". The correction is to remove the article "the" to make the sentence grammatically correct. The phrase "face-to-face human contacts" is a noun phrase that refers to a specific type of interaction, and it doesn't need the article "the" to specify it.

2. Error: contacts, Correction: contact

Explanation: The error is the plural form "contacts" used instead of the singular form "contact". The correction is to change "contacts" to "contact" to match the singular noun "face-to-face human contact". The sentence is referring to a single concept, "face-to-face human contact", which is a singular entity, so it should be referred to with the singular form "contact".
cleaned: 1. Error: the, Correction:
Label: 1. "Contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. When used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.




Error_sentence: Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Correct_sentence: Also , according to research , it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: a, Correction: 
Explanation: The error is the use of the indefinite article "a" before the noun "research". The correct article to use is "research" itself, since it is a singular noun. The correction is to remove the indefinite article "a" before "research".

2. Error: the, Correction: 
Explanation: The error is the use of the definite article "the" before the noun "Facebook". The correct article to use is no article at all, since "Facebook" is a proper noun. The correction is to remove the definite article "the" before "Facebook".

3. Error: the, Correction: 
Explanation: This error is the same as the previous one. The error is the use of the definite article "the" before the noun "people". The correct article to use is no article at all, since "people" is a common noun. The correction is to remove the definite article "the" before "people".
cleaned: 1. Error: a, Correction:
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.




Error_sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Correct_sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "but" vs. "and"

The error is a substitution of the coordinating conjunction "but" with the coordinating conjunction "and". In this context, "but" is used to contrast two ideas, whereas "and" is used to connect two ideas. The correct sentence uses "and" to indicate a continuation of the idea, rather than a contrast. The corrected sentence reads: "one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook". This means that the person may neglect the people around them and only communicate with friends on Facebook, rather than contrasting neglecting people with communicating with friends.
cleaned: 1. Error: "but" vs. "and"
Label: 1. "But" should be used in the situation where you do one thing, but not the other, so you could say, "they don't speak to the people around them, but do communicate with friends on Facebook," but in the context of your sentence, you are saying that both these actions are going on at the same time, so you should use "and", as in they shun/ignore the people around them AND only communicate with friends on Facebook.




Error_sentence: A family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .
Correct_sentence: A family of four having dinner in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

1. Error: "dinners" instead of "dinner"
Explanation: The error is a plural form ("dinners") instead of a singular form ("dinner"). In this context, "dinner" refers to a single meal, so the correct word is the singular form "dinner", not the plural form "dinners".
cleaned: 1. Error: "dinners" instead of "dinner"
Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner. A meal is still referred to in the singular when it is shared by multiple people. Therefore, it should be "having dinner" rather than "having dinners."




Error_sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma .
Correct_sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

**Error 1: "dilemma" -> "dilemmas"**

In the erroneous sentence, the word "dilemma" is used as a singular noun, implying a single ethical problem. However, the correct sentence uses the plural form "dilemmas" to indicate multiple ethical problems that could arise. This correction is necessary because the phrase "more family-related ethical" suggests that there could be multiple dilemmas, not just one.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. This is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. It should be the plural "dilemmas" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential ethical issues. 




Error_sentence: If your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Correct_sentence: If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Prediction: Here is a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1: "give" instead of "gives"

The verb "give" is in the infinitive form, which is not suitable in this sentence. The subject-verb agreement requires the verb to be in the third person singular form "gives" since "wife" is the subject. The correct sentence should use the verb "gives" to match the subject-verb agreement.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "gives" to go with "wife".




Error_sentence: With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network site now become a place to show off .
Correct_sentence: With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network sites now become a place to show off .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

**Error 1: site -> sites**

The error is a typo, where the singular form "site" is replaced with the plural form "sites". The correct sentence uses "sites" because social network refers to multiple platforms, not just one.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about social network sites in general, so "site" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .
Correct_sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: time, Correction: times

The error is a simple case of a singular noun (time) being used in a plural context. In this sentence, "hard time" is an idiomatic expression that refers to a period of difficulty or hardship, which is typically a plural concept (e.g., "hard times"). Therefore, the correction is to replace "time" with the plural form "times" to maintain grammatical accuracy and idiomatic expression.
cleaned: 1. Error: time, Correction: times
Label: 1. When generally referring to a period of hardship, time is pluralised, so the correct expression is "the hard times".




Error_sentence: It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected .
Correct_sentence: It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skills will be badly affected .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: on, Correction: 

Explanation: The word "on" is an incorrect preposition in this context. Instead, the correct preposition is "chatting" (gerund form of the verb "chat") to indicate the activity of chatting on the internet. The corrected sentence reads "It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet..."

2. Error: skill, Correction: skills

Explanation: The word "skill" is a singular noun, but in this context, it refers to a plural concept - the skills that people develop through face-to-face communication. Therefore, the correct form is the plural noun "skills". The corrected sentence reads "such that the interpersonal skills will be badly affected".
cleaned: 1. Error: on, Correction:
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".
2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct_sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Prediction: Based on the given information, here are the explanations for each error:

Error 1: "rely the" -> Correction: "on"
Explanation: The error is a prepositional phrase error. The correct preposition to use in this sentence is "on", indicating the relationship between the children and the parents, rather than "the", which is a definite article.

Error 2: "parent" -> Correction: "parents"
Explanation: The error is a grammatical error. The subject of the sentence is "children", which is a plural noun, so the object of the sentence should also be plural. "Parent" is a singular noun, whereas "parents" is the plural form, making it the correct correction.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
2. The subject is "children," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.




Error_sentence: This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
Correct_sentence: This could lead to psychological implications and thus cause many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society .
Prediction: Here is the explanation for each error:

**Error 1: causing -> cause**

The error is a verb tense inconsistency. In the erroneous sentence, the verb "causing" is in the present participle form, which doesn't agree with the main verb "could lead" in the past tense. In the corrected sentence, the verb "cause" is in the simple present tense, which is consistent with the main verb "could lead".
cleaned: 
Label: 1. This sentence is not talking about something that is currently happening, but something that could happen, so you need to change the present continuous "causing" to the present "cause".




Error_sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Correct_sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Prediction: Based on the given erroneous sentence and its correction, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error:

Error 1:
Original: "the manufacture company"
Corrected: "the manufacturing company"
Explanation: The error is a typo. "Manufacture" is a verb, whereas "manufacturing" is a noun. In this context, "manufacturing company" is the correct phrase to use.

Please let me know if you'd like me to explain the other errors!
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of to innovators in general.




Error_sentence: Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family .
Correct_sentence: Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden in her family .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: the, Correction: a

The error is a mistake in the use of articles. In the original sentence, "the" is used before the noun "burden", which is incorrect. The correct article to use is "a" because "burden" starts with a consonant sound and is a singular noun. The correction is to replace "the" with "a" to make the sentence grammatically correct.
cleaned: 1. Error: the, Correction: a
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."




Error_sentence: I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .
Correct_sentence: I noticed a real story in newspaper years ago .
Prediction: Here is the explanation for each error:

**Error 1: on, Correction: in**

The error "on" is incorrect because it is used to indicate a location or a position, whereas in this context, "in" is the correct preposition to use to indicate a location or a medium (in this case, a newspaper). In a sentence, "I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago" implies that the story is on top of the newspaper, which doesn't make sense. The corrected sentence "I noticed a real story in newspaper years ago" correctly indicates that the story is located within the newspaper.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".




Error_sentence: Looking at this third step we realize why the second stage of an engineering design process of gathering information is important.Once all the information is put together into the different possible solutions , the engineer is put to decide which method out of the lot is suited best for the purpose and if agrees with existing international laws .
Correct_sentence: Looking at this third step we realize why the second stage of an engineering design process of gathering information is important.Once all the information is put together into the different possible solutions , the engineer is put to decide which method out of the lot is suited best for the purpose and agrees with existing international laws .
Prediction: Here is the explanation for each error:

**Error 1:** `if` -> `and`
**Explanation:** The original sentence uses the word "if" which is a conditional word, implying that the engineer's decision is dependent on something. However, the corrected sentence uses the word "and", which is a conjunction connecting two independent clauses. The correct sentence means that the engineer decides which method is best for the purpose and also agrees with existing international laws.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.




Error_sentence: These are not the only challenges that the innovators are going to deal with .
Correct_sentence: These are not the only challenges that innovators are going to deal with .
Prediction: Based on the input, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error:

1. Error: the, Correction: 

Explanation: The error is a redundant article "the" which is not needed in the sentence. The correct sentence uses the plural noun "innovators" which is the subject of the sentence, so no article is required.
cleaned: 1. Error: the, Correction:
Label: 1. The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of to innovators in general.




Error_sentence: This is the common law in the society .
Correct_sentence: This is the common law in society .
Prediction: Based on the given information, I'll provide a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.

Error 1: the -> 
Explanation: The error is that the word "the" appears twice in the sentence, which is unnecessary and makes the sentence redundant. In the corrected sentence, the word "the" is removed to make the sentence concise and clear.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. As "society" is something general and uncountable, it does not need an article, so remove "the".




Error_sentence: When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
Correct_sentence: When people around us know that we got a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , whether caring for us too much or keeping away from us .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: , Correction: a

The error is a missing article ("a") before the noun "certain disease". In English, it is common to use the indefinite article "a" before a singular noun that refers to a specific but unknown or indefinite thing. In this case, "a certain disease" is a specific but unknown disease, so the correct phrase is "a certain disease" instead of just "certain disease".

2. Error: altitudes, Correction: attitudes

The error is a mistake in the word choice. "Altitudes" refers to the height or elevation of something, whereas "attitudes" refers to a person's feelings or opinions towards something. In this sentence, the correct word is "attitudes", as it describes how people's feelings or opinions will change when they know someone has a certain disease.

3. Error: , Correction: for

The error is a missing preposition ("for") before the phrase "caring us". The correct phrase is "caring for us", which means showing concern or affection for someone. The preposition "for" is necessary to indicate the object of the verb "caring", which is "us".
cleaned: 1. Error: , Correction: a
Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.




Error_sentence: Therefore , considering the people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Correct_sentence: Therefore , considering people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Prediction: Here is the explanation for the error:

Error 1: the -> (no correction needed)

Explanation: The error is the presence of the definite article "the" before the possessive pronoun "people's". In English, when a possessive pronoun is used, it is not necessary to include a definite article before it. The corrected sentence simply uses the possessive form "people's" without the article "the".
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The sentence is talking about people in general, so it does not need an article.




Error_sentence: Otherwise , making it an obligation will restric the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
Correct_sentence: Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

1. "restric" instead of "restrict":
The error "restric" is a typo or a spelling mistake. The correct word is "restrict", which is a verb that means to limit or hinder something. In this sentence, "restrict" is used to convey the idea that making something an obligation will limit the choice of carriers, whereas "restric" is not a valid word in English.
cleaned: 1. "restric" instead of "restrict":
Label: 1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "restrict".




Error_sentence: With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status .
Correct_sentence: With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and statuses .
Prediction: Here's a simple explanation for each error:

1. Error: status, Correction: statuses

The error is a singular noun (status) used in a plural context (photos and statuses). The correct form of the noun is "statuses", which is the plural form of "status", indicating multiple statuses. This error occurs because the singular form "status" is used to refer to multiple statuses, which is incorrect grammatically.
cleaned: 1. Error: status, Correction: statuses
Label: 1. The list is talking about things in general, and so "status" should be pluralised to match "conversations", "blogs" and "photos".




Error_sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .
Correct_sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay for another year in the secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top student in his province .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: , Correction: for

The error is a missing article ("the") before the noun "next year". The corrected sentence uses the article "the" to specify which year is being referred to, making the sentence clearer and more precise.

2. Error: , Correction: the

The error is a missing article ("the") before the noun "secondary school". The corrected sentence uses the article "the" to refer to a specific secondary school, making the sentence more specific and easier to understand.

3. Error: 1, Correction: 

The error is a mistake in the expected ranking. The student is expecting to become the top student in his province, not the top 1 student (which would imply they are the first student out of one student). The corrected sentence removes the unnecessary "1" and makes the sentence more logical and coherent.
cleaned: 1. Error: , Correction: for
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.




Error_sentence: These implants and products are also been used as surveillance tools .
Correct_sentence: These implants and products have also been used as surveillance tools .
Prediction: Based on the given erroneous sentence and its correction, I can provide a simple explanation for each error:

1. Error: are, Correction: have

The error is in the verb tense. The sentence is in the present perfect tense, which requires the use of "have" instead of "are". In the present perfect tense, "have" is used to indicate that an action started in the past and continues up to the present moment. In this sentence, the action of using the implants and products as surveillance tools started in the past and continues up to the present, so "have" is the correct verb to use.
cleaned: 1. Error: are, Correction: have
Label: 1. The perfect present tense should be used to show that the action of using implants and products is currently still happening. To create the perfect present, we use "have" and the past participle "used." 




Error_sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .
Correct_sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring some negative effects on our daily lives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "in" instead of "some"
Explanation: The correct word is "some" instead of "in" because "some" is a determiner that indicates a quantity, whereas "in" is a preposition that indicates location or movement. In this context, "some" is needed to indicate the quantity of negative effects being referred to.

2. Error: "life" instead of "lives"
Explanation: The correct word is "lives" instead of "life" because the sentence is referring to the daily experiences or routines of multiple people, which is plural ("lives"). "Life" is a singular noun that refers to one person's existence.

3. Error: "effect" instead of "effects"
Explanation: The correct word is "effects" instead of "effect" because the sentence is referring to multiple negative consequences or outcomes, which is plural ("effects"). "Effect" is a singular noun that refers to one specific outcome or result.
cleaned: 1. Error: "in" instead of "some"
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
3. This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .
Correct_sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
Prediction: Here is a simple explanation for each error:

1. "immediate" should be "immediately":

The error is a typo, where the word "immediate" is used instead of the adverb "immediately". "Immediate" refers to something that happens quickly or without delay, whereas "immediately" is used to describe an action that happens quickly or without delay. In this context, "immediately" is the correct word to use, as it is describing the timing of the dissemination of information.
cleaned: 1. "immediate" should be "immediately":
Label: 1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".




Error_sentence: With the aids of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily .
Correct_sentence: With the aid of social media , people bond globally , information flows rapidly , and humans live happily .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: bonds, Correction: bond

The error is a plural form "bonds" instead of the singular form "bond". In English, when we talk about a single instance of people forming a connection or relationship, we use the singular form "bond". In this sentence, it should be "people bond globally" instead of "people bonds globally".

2. Error: human, Correction: humans

The error is a singular form "human" instead of the plural form "humans". In English, when we talk about multiple individuals, we use the plural form of the noun. In this sentence, it should be "humans live happily" instead of "human live happily".

3. Error: lives, Correction: live

The error is a verb form "lives" (which is a plural form) instead of the verb form "live" (which is a singular form). In English, when we talk about a single instance of something happening, we use the singular form of the verb. In this sentence, it should be "and humans live happily" instead of "and humans lives happily".

4. Error: aids, Correction: aid

The error is a plural form "aids" instead of
cleaned: 1. Error: bonds, Correction: bond
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "bond" to go with "people".
2. This sentence is talking about humans in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "live" to go with "humans".
4. "Aid" used in the sense of help or assistance is an uncountable noun and therefore should not be pluralised.




Error_sentence: We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
Correct_sentence: We can not deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
Prediction: Based on the given information, I can identify the error and provide an explanation for it.

Error 1: the
Correction: None (no correction needed)

Explanation: The error is the presence of the definite article "the" before the noun "genetic testing". However, since "genetic testing" is a specific type of testing, it is not necessary to use the definite article "the" before it. The corrected sentence does not include the article "the" before "genetic testing", making it grammatically correct.

Let me know if you'd like me to explain any other errors!
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The concept of "genetic testing" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific type or instance of genetic testing, instead of the concept in general.




Error_sentence: Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
Correct_sentence: Family members , as one the closest groups of people from whom they can get comfort , are a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "group" instead of "groups"

The error is a singular noun ("group") used to refer to a plural concept (a collection of people). In this context, "groups" is the correct choice because it agrees with the plural subject "Family members" and indicates that there are multiple groups of people involved.

2. Error: "is" instead of "are"

The error is a singular verb ("is") used to refer to a plural subject ("Family members"). In this sentence, "Family members" is a plural noun, so the verb "are" is the correct choice to agree with it. The subject-verb agreement rule states that a singular subject takes a singular verb, while a plural subject takes a plural verb.
cleaned: 1. Error: "group" instead of "groups"
Label: 1. The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so use the plural "groups".
2. This connects back to "family members" at the beginning of the sentence, so you need to use the plural, "are", as in "Family members are a crucial factor...".




Error_sentence: However,there are still people against the decision of revealing private information.As in the case of Alzheimer patients,it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who,how and whom will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members ( DementiaToday,2012 ) .There are associations provide helps to Alzheimer patients like Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association,1980 ) .Although there are still thousand of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all helps and supports from everyone,the needs to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult time .
Correct_sentence: However,there are still people against the decision of revealing private information.As in the case of Alzheimer patients,it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who,how and whom will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members ( DementiaToday,2012 ) .There are associations provide helps to Alzheimer patients like Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association,1980 ) .Although there are still thousands of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all help and support from everyone,the need to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult time .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "thousand" instead of "thousands"

The error is a simple typo. The correct word is "thousands", which is the plural form of "thousand", whereas "thousand" is a singular noun. The correct sentence uses the plural form "thousands" to indicate a large number of genetic risk diseases.

2. Error: "helps" instead of "help"

The error is a verb agreement mistake. The verb "to help" is a singular verb, and it should agree with the singular noun "help". The correct sentence uses the singular form "help" to indicate the assistance that patients need.

3. Error: "supports" instead of "support"

The error is similar to the previous one. The verb "to support" is a singular verb, and it should agree with the singular noun "support". The correct sentence uses the singular form "support" to indicate the assistance that patients need.

4. Error: "needs" instead of "need"

The error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. The subject "patient" is a singular noun, and it should agree with the singular verb "need". The correct sentence uses the singular form "need" to indicate the
cleaned: 1. Error: "thousand" instead of "thousands"
Label: 1. This sentence is not using "thousand" as a specific number, i.e. 1,000, it is using it metaphorically to express a large, unspecified amount. In this case, it should be pluralised as "thousands".
2. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
3. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
4. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.




Error_sentence: It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes .
Correct_sentence: It is also important to use better material that can support buildings during any natural disasters like earthquakes .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: create, Correction: use
The error is the use of the verb "create" instead of "use". The sentence should state that it's important to use better material, not create it. This is because the sentence is talking about using existing materials to support buildings, not creating new ones.

2. Error: a, Correction: 
The error is the unnecessary use of the indefinite article "a" before the noun "better material". Since "better material" is a singular noun, it doesn't need the indefinite article. The corrected sentence simply states "better material" without the article.

3. Error: the, Correction: 
Similar to the previous error, the unnecessary use of the definite article "the" before the noun "buildings" is corrected by removing it. The sentence simply states "buildings" without the article.

4. Error: despite, Correction: during
The error is the use of the preposition "despite" instead of "during". "Despite" is used to indicate that something happens in spite of a particular circumstance, whereas "during" indicates that something happens while a particular circumstance is occurring. In this sentence, it's important to state that the buildings are supported during
cleaned: 1. Error: create, Correction: use
Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.




Error_sentence: The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Correct_sentence: The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic devices until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

**Error 1: device -> devices**

The erroneous sentence uses the singular form "device" when it should be the plural form "devices". This is because the phrase "using electronic" is describing a plural noun, indicating that multiple electronic devices are being used.
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Auto-correct is a feature that is common to many different electronic devices, so the plural "devices" should be used. The singular "device" is used to refer to individual devices, with "a device" meaning any device and "the device" meaning one specific device.
