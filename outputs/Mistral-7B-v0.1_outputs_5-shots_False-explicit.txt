Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

Error_sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct_sentence: One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .
Prediction: 
1. The sentence mentions multiple people, so "interest" should be pluralised, as there are multiple interests.
2. The sentence is talking about a loss of interest, so use the negative "loss".
Erroneous sentence: The other disadvantage is that people can not have a real face-to-face communication with their friends and relatives , because they are always busy with their phone and they are not able to see their friends and relatives in real life .
Correct sentence: The other disadvantage is that people can not have real face-to-face communication with their friends and relatives , because they are always busy with their phone and they are not able to see their friends and relatives in real life .
Explanations:
1. The sentence is talking about real face-to-face communication, so use the adjective "real" to modify "face-to-face".
2. The sentence is talking about real life, so use the adjective "real" to modify "life".
Erroneous sentence: In addition , the carrier will not be able to tell their relatives and friends about their condition , because they are afraid that their relatives and friends will look down on them and they will be treat differently .
Correct sentence: In addition , the carrier will not be able to tell their relatives and friends about their condition , because they are afraid that their relatives and friends will look down on them and they will be treated differently .
Explanations:

2. The sentence is talking about being treated differently, so use the bare infinitive "treat" to correspond with "are".
Erroneous sentence: The carrier will not be able to tell their relatives and friends about their condition , because they are afraid that their relatives and friends will look down on them and they will be treat differently .

cleaned: 1. The sentence mentions multiple people, so "interest" should be pluralised, as there are multiple interests.
2. The sentence is talking about a loss of interest, so use the negative "loss".
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.

2. This sentence is either referring to the parents of specific children, or parents and children in general, but either way, "parents" should be pluralised.

cleaned: 1. The verb "discourage" means to make someone less likely to do something. It is followed by the preposition "from."
2. The subject is "engineers," which is plural, so the verb should be "have."
3. The subject is "engineers," which is plural, so the verb should be "have."
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."

2. The phrase "in anyone" is not commonly used. The preposition "in" means to be contained within, so it is not necessary to add the possessive "anyone's" to the phrase.

Correct sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .
Explanations:
1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.

Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.

Error_sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Correct_sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Prediction: 
1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "The next generation" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "the next generation," which implies that the outcome is one of several.

Error_sentence: The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people .
Correct_sentence: The social network may also creat some negative impacts for people .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "people" is a collective noun, meaning a group of people. It is used to refer to a group of people as a whole, so it is always plural.
2. The verb "create" is used with a noun, but "impacts" is the plural of the noun "impact." The plural "impacts" is used to refer to multiple impacts, so the verb form should be changed to the plural "creates."

Error_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
Correct_sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
Prediction: 
1. The present tense "shall" implies that RFID technology is already available to the public, so it should be changed to the present conditional "should" instead.
2. The present tense "taken" implies that RFID technology is already available to the public, so it should be changed to the present conditional "taken" instead.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
Correct sentence: In addition , privacy issues have become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share in the first place .
Explanations:
1. This sentence is talking about privacy issues in general, so "issue" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Privacy issues" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
3. Incorrect word. The correct expression is "in the first place".
Erroneous sentence: In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Correct sentence: In past decades , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Explanations:
1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."
Erroneous sentence
cleaned: 1. The present tense "shall" implies that RFID technology is already available to the public, so it should be changed to the present conditional "should" instead.
2. The present tense "taken" implies that RFID technology is already available to the public, so it should be changed to the present conditional "taken" instead.
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.




Error_sentence: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Correct_sentence: In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees to spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Prediction: 
1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.
2. The plural "networks" is used because social media networks are not limited to one.
3. The verb "spend" is used with the preposition "on" to indicate that time is spent doing something. The preposition "on" is used to indicate the object of an action, so it is used with "spend" to indicate what the time is spent on.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Correct sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Explanations:
1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.
Erroneous sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Correct sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Explanations:
1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
Erroneous sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Correct sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone
cleaned: 1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.
2. The plural "networks" is used because social media networks are not limited to one.
3. The verb "spend" is used with the preposition "on" to indicate that time is spent doing something. The preposition "on" is used to indicate the object of an action, so it is used with "spend" to indicate what the time is spent on.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."




Error_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .
Correct_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used on the social media sites .
Prediction: 
1. The preposition "on" is used to indicate that the writing skills are being reduced by the use of social media sites.
2. The verb "reduce" is always followed by the preposition "to" or "towards." It means to make something smaller or less, and it is a collocation.
Erroneous sentence: The social media sites are not only a platform for people to connect with each other , but also a place for people to share their personal information .

Erroneous sentence: The social media sites are not only a platform for people to connect with each other , but also a place for people to share their personal information
cleaned: 1. The preposition "on" is used to indicate that the writing skills are being reduced by the use of social media sites.
2. The verb "reduce" is always followed by the preposition "to" or "towards." It means to make something smaller or less, and it is a collocation.
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Error_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Correct_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "despite of" is not commonly used. It is more common to use "despite" on its own.
2. The concept of "distance" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific distance instead of the general concept.

Correct_sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal moral morals the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "personal moral" is used to refer to an individual's moral values, but the phrase "personal morals" is used to refer to the morals of an individual. The meaning of this sentence is that the decision depends on the morals of the individual, so "morals" should be used.
2. The phrase "the nature of how 'directive' the risk is to them" is a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.

cleaned: 1. The phrase "personal moral" is used to refer to an individual's moral values, but the phrase "personal morals" is used to refer to the morals of an individual. The meaning of this sentence is that the decision depends on the morals of the individual, so "morals" should be used.

2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."

Explanations:
1. Incorrect preposition. As "risk" is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
Erroneous sentence: On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .

The sentence is not saying that the carrier's relatives are not able to take preventive measures, but that they are not aware of them. The sentence should be reworded to say that they are not able to take preventive measures because they are not aware of them.

cleaned: 1. The preposition "of" is used to indicate the source or origin of something, while "for" is used to indicate the purpose or reason for something. The sentence is talking about the purpose of writing, so "for" should be used.

Error_sentence: While we do know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
Correct_sentence: While we do know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
Prediction: 
1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly.

These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."

Explanations:
1. Incorrect preposition. As "risk" is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".

Correct sentence: The carrier may not want to tell his or her relatives , because he or she is afraid that the relatives may not understand him or her , and may not want to tell his or her relatives , because he or she is afraid that the relatives may not understand him or her .
Explanations:
1. The sentence is correct, but the meaning is not clear. The sentence is saying that the carrier is afraid that the relatives may not understand him or her, but the sentence does not say what the carrier is afraid of. The carrier may be afraid that the relatives will not understand the carrier's decision, or the carrier may be afraid that the relatives will not understand the carrier's condition. The sentence should be rephrased to clarify the meaning.

Correct_sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows .
Prediction: 
1. The definite article "the" is used to refer to a specific society, but here it is referring to society in general, so use the indefinite article "a".
2. The definite article "the" is used to refer to a specific society, but here it is referring to society in general, so use the indefinite article "a".
Erroneous sentence: The advantages of using social media are that it is able to keep in touch with friends and family , regardless of their location .
Correct sentence: The advantages of using social media are that it is able to keep in touch with friends and family , regardless of their location .
Explanations:
1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.

Correct sentence: The disadvantages of using social media are that it is able to cause distraction , and it is able to cause people to become addicted to it .

Erroneous sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .
Correct sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation , particularly small children who are studying in nursery .
Explanations:

2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own.
3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.
Erroneous sentence: It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other .
Correct sentence: It is weird that people sit around the table but all face their phones and do not talk with to other .
Explanations:
1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.
Erroneous sentence: That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
Correct sentence: That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .

Error_sentence: People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
Correct_sentence: People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "great length" is an idiom that means "a great deal of effort." It is always plural, so it should be changed to "lengths."
2. The phrase "as short as they can" is an idiom that means "as short as possible." It is always plural, so it should be changed to "short."

Correct sentence: In the past , people would have to go to the hospital to get their blood test done , and it would take a few days to get the results back .
Explanations:
1. The plural "results" is used because the sentence is referring to the results of multiple blood tests.
2. The plural "results" is used because the sentence is referring to the results of multiple blood tests.
Erroneous sentence: The genetic risk is not only limited to the carrier , but also to the carrier 's relatives .
Correct sentence: The genetic risk is not only limited to the carrier , but also to the carrier 's relatives .
Explanations:
1. The phrase "not only" is used to contrast with "also." The sentence is saying that the genetic risk is limited to the carrier, but also to the carrier's relatives. Therefore, the phrase "not only" should be repeated.
Erroneous sentence: In the past , people would have to go to the hospital to get their blood test done , and it would take a few days to get the result back .
Correct sentence: In the past , people would have to go to the hospital to get their blood test done , and it would take a few days to get the results back .
Explanations:
1. The plural "results" is used because the sentence is referring to the results of multiple blood tests.
2. The plural "results" is used because the sentence is referring to the results of multiple blood tests.
Erroneous sentence: This is because the carrier 's relatives may have the same genetic risk as the carrier , and they may not know about it .
Correct sentence: This is because the carrier 's relatives may have the same genetic risk as the carrier , and they may not know about it .
Explanations:
1. The phrase "not only
cleaned: 1. The phrase "great length" is an idiom that means "a great deal of effort." It is always plural, so it should be changed to "lengths."
2. The phrase "as short as they can" is an idiom that means "as short as possible." It is always plural, so it should be changed to "short."
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".

Correct_sentence: However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
Prediction: 
1. The concept of "social media sites" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific site, instead of the concept in general.
2. The phrase "the existence of" is used to mean that something exists, but it is not used with the present tense. It is used with the past tense to mean that something came into existence, and with the present tense to mean that something exists now. Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "have" to the past form "had."
Erroneous sentence: The social media sites have also been used to spread rumors and fake news , which may cause a lot of trouble to the society .
Correct sentence: The social media sites have also been used to spread rumors and fake news , which may cause a lot of trouble to society .

2. The phrase "the existence of" is used to mean that something exists, but it is not used with the present tense. It is used with the past tense to mean that something came into existence, and with the present tense to mean that something exists now. Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "have" to the past form "had."
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".

Correct_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Prediction: 
1. The phrase "the social media" is redundant. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the social media" implies that there is only one social media platform. The phrase "social media" refers to many different social media platforms.
2. The preposition "on" indicates that the Internet is a platform or surface on which social media is used. The preposition "and" indicates that social media and the Internet are two separate things that are used together.

Correct sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Explanations:
1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that

2. The preposition "on" indicates that the Internet is a platform or surface on which social media is used. The preposition "and" indicates that social media and the Internet are two separate things that are used together.
Label: 1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.




Error_sentence: Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .
Correct_sentence: Social media provides people with a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .

Correct_sentence: Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .

2. The phrase "in Singapore" is correct, but the phrase "in the China" is incorrect. The country "China" is a proper noun and does not need the preposition "in."

Prediction: 
1. The present tense "passes" is used to refer to actions that occur over an unspecified amount of time in the present or future. The past tense "passed" is used to refer to actions that occurred over an unspecified amount of time in the past. The present tense is used because the sentence is talking about actions that are still occurring.

Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often.

Prediction: 
1. The plural noun "skills" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing skills as a general concept, the plural "skills" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "skill" is used to refer to an individual skill, with "a skill" meaning any skill and "the skill" meaning one skill specifically.
Erroneous sentence: However , the social media sites are not the only one who can do the job , there are many other ways to get the information .
Correct sentence: However , the social media sites are not the only one who can do the job , there are many other ways to get information .

Correct_sentence: There are many people on social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages , however in real life , he or she may not have jobs or live poorly .

The phrase "on social media" is used to indicate that people use social media sites, while "in social media" is used to indicate that people are part of social media sites.

Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.




Error_sentence: The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him .
Correct_sentence: The medical treatment technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
Prediction: 
1. The past perfect tense is used to talk about a past action that was completed before another past action.

Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."

Correct_sentence: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Prediction: 
1. The concept of "catastrophes" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific catastrophes instead of the concept in general.
2. The verb "give rise" is a phrasal verb, and the preposition "to" is always used with it.
Erroneous sentence: This is because the social media sites are the main platform for people to communicate with each other , and it is also the main platform for people to share their opinions and thoughts .
Correct sentence: This is because the social media sites are the main platform for people to communicate with each other , and it is also the main platform for people to share their opinions and thoughts .
Explanations:
1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "the main platform," but sometimes "the main platforms," referring to multiple platforms. There is no article in the plural "the main platforms," but otherwise an article is always used.

Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.

2. The sentence is talking about the end of a marriage, so "death" should be changed to "end" to match.
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.

Correct sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to .

cleaned: 1. The sentence is talking about a specific school, so it should be "the secondary school", not "a secondary school".
2. The sentence is talking about a specific year, so it should be "the next year", not "another year".
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.

Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.
