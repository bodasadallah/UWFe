1. error: qualified 
explanation: the word "qualified" is unnecessary in this context because it does not add any meaning to the sentence. it should be omitted to improve clarity and conciseness.

2. error: resource 
explanation: the noun "resource" should be pluralized as "resources" to correctly indicate that there is a lack of multiple types of human resources, rather than just a single resource.

1. the error in using "side" instead of "hand" is a common mistake that is easily overlooked when writing. in this context, "hand" is the more appropriate term to use to contrast two different perspectives or options.
2. the error in using "want" instead of "wants" is a subject-verb agreement mistake. in this case, the correct verb form should be "wants" to match the singular subject "person."

1. the error here is the use of the word "disadvantage" instead of the plural form "disadvantages" to match the plural noun "people".
2. there is an extra "the" before "interest" which is unnecessary in this context.
3. the preposition "of" should be changed to "in" to make the sentence more grammatically correct.

the error is using "shall" instead of "should." in this context, "should" is the correct modal verb to express a recommendation or preference, while "shall" is typically used for expressing future tense or formality. 

2. error: usage, correction: use
explanation: the error is using the word "usage" instead of "use." "usage" typically refers to the way something is used, while "use" is the correct term when referring to the act of using something.
the error is using "with" instead of "for." in this context, "for" is the appropriate preposition to indicate the purpose or reason for leaking users' information to companies.

1. error explanation: "researches" should be corrected to "research" because the word "research" is an uncountable noun and should not be pluralized.
2. error explanation: "show" should be corrected to "shows" to match the singular noun "research." this ensures subject-verb agreement in the sentence.

1. error: the preposition "of" is incorrect here. in this context, we use "for" to show the reason behind something.
2. error: a comma is missing before the word "the" to separate the clauses properly.
3. error: another missing comma before the word "the" to separate the clauses properly.
4. error: the phrase "halt of work" should be "halt of the work" as "work" is a countable noun here.
the error is in the plural form of "polices." the correct term should be "police" because it refers to a collective group of individuals in a specific profession.

2. error: hoaxes spreading, correction: hoaxes from spreading
explanation: the error is in the incorrect use of the word "around" after "hoaxes spreading." the correct preposition to use in this context is "from," which clarifies that the action of preventing hoaxes is directed towards stopping them from spreading.
subject-verb agreement error. "user" is singular, so the verb "comes" should also be singular to agree with it.
1. the error in the erroneous sentence is the missing preposition "on" after the verb "rely." the correct sentence should use the preposition "on" to show who or what the children are relying on.
2. the error in the erroneous sentence is the singular noun "parent" being used instead of the plural noun "parents." since it is likely that children have more than one parent, the correct sentence should use the plural form of the noun.

2. error: their, correction: the
explanation: the error here is using the possessive pronoun "their" before "relatives." in this case, the correct article to use is "the" instead of a possessive pronoun.
1. the word "about" is unnecessary in this context. "discuss" already implies talking about something, so it is redundant to include "about".
2. the word "life" should be changed to "lives" to match the plural noun "advantages and disadvantages".
the error is a subject-verb agreement issue. the subject "internet" is singular, so it should be followed by the singular form of the verb "connects" instead of the plural "connect."

2. error: missing comma after "time", correction: add a comma after "time"
explanation: the error is a punctuation issue. a comma should be used to separate the two independent clauses "internet saves people's time" and "also connects people globally" in the sentence.
1. error: "the" - the word "the" is unnecessary before "social media." "social media" is a general concept, so it does not require a specific article.
2. error:  , correction: in - the preposition "with" was missing after the word contact. the correct phrase is "get in contact with."
the error is in the incorrect pluralization of "add-on." in this sentence, it should be "add-ons" to indicate that there are multiple entertainment features included.
1. error: the, correction: however ,
explanation: "the" is a definite article, while "however" is an adverb used to introduce a contrast or exception. in this context, "however" is more appropriate to show the relationship between the two parts of the sentence.

2. error: using, correction: use
explanation: "using" is the present participle form of the verb "use", which is not needed in this context. the base form "use" should be used here as it is the correct conjugation for the sentence structure.

3. error: over, correction: on
explanation: the preposition "over" is incorrect in this context. "on" is the appropriate preposition to use to indicate how something is directed or affects someone/something.

4. error: on, correction: over
explanation: the correct preposition to show possession or control in this context is "over", not "on". the sentence is discussing power and influence that someone or something has over the subject.
the error is in the use of the wrong article before the word "right." it should be "the" instead of "their." 

2. error: healthiness, correction: health
explanation: the word "healthiness" is not commonly used in english. the correct term to use in this context is "health."
the error is a simple spelling mistake: "belive" should be "believe."

2. error: tell still, correction: tell
explanation: "tell still" is redundant and unnecessary. the word "still" does not add any meaning to the sentence and should be removed.
1. the error is using "to make" instead of the correct form "from making". the correct usage is "discourages engineers from making more effort" because "from" is used before the gerund form of a verb.

2. the error is using "for" instead of the correct conjunction "and". the correct usage is "to do research and design" to show that engineers should make more effort in both research and design.

3. the error is an unnecessary word "will" that disrupts the flow of the sentence. the correction removes this word to make the sentence clearer and more concise.
1. the error is using "other's" which implies possession, but in this context, it should be "permission" without possession. 
2. the error is the missing word "technology" after the word "permission" which is needed to clarify what should not be placed or implanted. 
3. the error is the incorrect preposition "to" which should be replaced with "in" to correctly convey the action of placing or implanting.
the error is in the use of "years" instead of "year", since "one year ago" is referring to a singular period of time.

2. error: invoving, correction: involving
explanation: the error is a spelling mistake, with the correct spelling of the word being "involving" in this context.

3. error: singapore, correction: singapore
explanation: the error is in the capitalization of "singapore", which should always be capitalized as it is a proper noun.
the error is in verb tense. "thought" is past tense, while "think" is present tense, which is more appropriate in this context since the speaker is expressing a current opinion or belief.

2. error: be obligated, correction: be obligated
explanations: there are no errors in this part of the sentence.
the error is a verb agreement mistake. the verb "transfer" should be in the past tense form "transferred" to match the tense of "is recorded" in the sentence.
1. in the error, "shwing" is a misspelling of "showing." the correct spelling should be used to convey the intended meaning of displaying or sharing.
2. in the error, "experience" should be in the plural form "experiences" to properly match the plural subject "people." this ensures agreement between the subject and verb in the sentence.
using "more" before the adjective "easier" is redundant because "easier" already implies a comparison between two things. adding "more" is unnecessary.
the error is the use of the word "internet" without the article "the" before it. the correction adds "the" before "internet" to make it grammatically correct.
1. error: the incorrect use of "with" after "talk" is not needed in this context. 
explanation: the preposition "to" is used after the verb "talk" when indicating who the conversation is directed towards.

2. error: the unnecessary "with" after "talk".
explanation: the preposition "to" is used after the verb "talk" in this context to indicate who the conversation is directed towards.
the error is a subject-verb agreement mistake. "elements" is plural, but it should be singular to match the verb "is."

2. error: n/a, correction: n/a
explanations: there are no additional errors in the given sentence.
1. the error is using "is happen" instead of "happens." this is incorrect because "happens" is the correct present tense form of the verb.
2. the error is the unnecessary use of "the" before "country." this is incorrect because when referring to countries in general, the article "the" should not be used.
3. the error is using "country" instead of "countries." this is incorrect because the sentence is referring to multiple countries, so the plural form should be used.
4. the error is using "is" instead of "are" to match the plural noun "countries." this is incorrect because the verb should agree in number with the noun it is referring to.
5. the error is the unnecessary use of "back" after "find the child." this is incorrect because "find the child back" is redundant, as the sentence already implies that the parents are trying to locate the child.
the error is in the plural form of the word "challenges." in this context, "challenge" should be singular because it refers to a single obstacle or difficulty faced by the innovators. 

2. error: none
explanations: there are no other errors in the sentence.
1. error: "issue," should be pluralized to "issues" to indicate that there are multiple privacy concerns.
2. error: "has" should be changed to "have" to agree with the plural subject "privacy issues."
3. error: "at the first place" should be changed to "in the first place" to correctly express the idea of the original intention or starting point.
1. explanation: the error is in subject-verb agreement. "both of his parents" is plural, so the verb should be "have" instead of "has."
2. explanation: the use of "under" is incorrect in this context. the correct preposition to use with "high risk" is "at."
3. explanation: the use of "under" is incorrect in this context. the correct preposition to use with "high risk" is "at."
4. explanation: the error is in the spelling of "running." the correct form should be "running."
the error is using a comma before "the" instead of the word "the." this is a simple grammar mistake as articles like "the" should be used before a noun to specify which one is being referenced. 

2. error:  down to next generation, correction: down to the next generation,
explanation: the error is missing the word "the" before "next generation." this is a grammatical error as the word "the" is necessary before a noun in this context to specify which generation is being referred to. 

3. error: involve more than just one family . correction: involve more than just one family.
explanation: the error is having a space before the period at the end of the sentence. this is a simple typographical mistake as spaces should not come before punctuation marks like periods.
the error is an unnecessary article "the" before the noun "people." the correct sentence does not require an article before the noun "people" in this context.
1. error: using "shall" suggests a stronger sense of obligation or necessity, while "should" better conveys a recommendation or opinion in this context.
2. error: "available to" is the correct phrasing to indicate something is accessible to a group of people.
3. error: "or" is more appropriate to show a contrast between rfid technology not being easily available and not being taken for granted.

explanation: the correct phrase is "the more the writing skills," not "the more of the writing skills."

2. error: the preposition "in" is incorrect, it should be "on." 
explanation: the correct phrase is "time used on the social media sites," not "time used in the social media sites."
the error here is the unnecessary use of "of" after "despite". the correct usage is "despite the distance" without "of".
the error here is the unnecessary use of the word "the" before "social media." "the" is not needed in this context because we are talking about social media in general, not a specific instance of social media.
1. error: the word "moral" should be pluralized to "morals" to match the plural noun "personal". this is because "personal" is describing the type of morals being discussed.
2. error: the extra "the" before "nature" is not needed in this sentence. removing it improves the clarity and flow of the sentence.
the error is the unnecessary article "a" before "birthday wishes". the correction removes the article "a" to make the sentence grammatically correct.
1. the error is using "thought" when referring to multiple thoughts, which should be corrected to "thoughts" to maintain proper grammar and clarity.

2. the error is using "personalities" when referring to an individual's personality, which should be corrected to "personality" to indicate that it is a singular trait unique to each person.
the error here is using "life" instead of "lives." this is because "lives" should be used in this context to indicate that it is referring to the lives of multiple people, not just one person. 

2. error: missing verb agreement, correction: make
explanations: the verb "make" should agree with the subject "social media," which is plural. so, it should be "make" instead of "makes."

explanations: this error does not have an explanation as it appears to be correct. 

3. error: where, correction: where

2. the error is using the singular form "relationship" when it should be the plural form "relationships" to match the subject.
the error in this sentence is the unnecessary use of the article "a" before the word "knowledge." in this context, "knowledge" is a non-count noun and should not have an article before it.
the error is a spelling mistake. the correct spelling of the word is "obvious", not "obvioualy". 

2. error: missing comma after "side"
explanation: the error is a missing punctuation. a comma is needed after "side" to separate the two clauses of the sentence.
the error is in subject-verb agreement. "social media" is singular, so it should be matched with the singular form of the verb "does."

2. error: missing comma before "and"
explanation: a comma should be placed before the conjunction "and" when joining two independent clauses.
error: the word "for" is unnecessary in this context. 
explanation: the correct phrase is "to be shy or afraid of," without the need for the word "for."
the error here is using "but" instead of "and". the correct conjunction to use in this sentence is "and" because the sentence is listing actions that can potentially happen together, not contrasting them.

2. error: on facebook, correction: on facebook
explanations: this error is a lack of capitalization for the word "facebook", which is a proper noun and should always be capitalized.
the error here is the use of a comma before the word "an." the correct word should be "an" instead of a comma because it is needed before the adjective "effective" to show that it is referring to a singular noun.

2. error:  pace, correction: pace
explanation: there is no error in this correction.
1. the definite article "the" should not be used before "past decades" because we are referring to decades in a general sense, not any specific set of decades.
2. "are" should be changed to "were" to maintain consistency in verb tense. the sentence is discussing a past time period.
3. "connect" should be changed to "connected" to match the past tense used throughout the sentence.
4. "live" should be changed to "lived" to indicate that the action of living far away occurred in the past.
the error is the use of "gene" instead of "genes." in this context, "genes" should be used to refer to the genetic material being altered.
the error here is the unnecessary use of the article "the" before "study." in this case, "study in the genetic field" is a general concept and does not need a specific article.
1. the error in using "the" before "face-to-face human contacts" is that "contacts" is already a plural noun, so it does not need "the" before it in this context. 
2. the error in using "contacts" instead of "contact" is that the singular form "contact" is more appropriate in this sentence since it refers to the overall concept of human interaction, rather than individual instances of contact.
1. error: "researches" is incorrect because in this context, "research" is used as a noun. "research" is already plural and does not need an additional "es" at the end.
explanation: use the singular form "research" when referring to a body of work or investigation.

2. error: "show" is incorrect because it does not agree in number with the singular subject "research." the correct form to use is "shows."
explanation: make sure the verb agrees with the subject in terms of number.
the error here is the use of "of" instead of "for". in this context, we use "for" to show the purpose or reason for having a skill. in this case, writing is essential for a person to express their feelings and opinions.
the word "against" is more appropriate in this context. discrimination is typically directed against someone or something, not "based on" them.
1. the error lies in using a comma before "products" when it should be a period to separate the phrases. this creates a run-on sentence.
2. the error is in using "system" instead of the plural form "systems" to match the plural noun "products."
subject-verb agreement error. "expressing themselves appropriately" is singular, so the verb "becomes" should be used instead of "become."
the error here is a missing article "the" before the word "internet". this is needed to specify which internet is being referred to.
1. error: "each others" should be corrected to "each other" because "each other" is a reciprocal pronoun used when referring to two or more people or things who are doing something to or for each other.
2. error: "more important aspect" should be corrected to "more important role" because in this context, "role" is more appropriate to describe the significance and function of face-to-face human interaction.
the definite article "the" is unnecessary before the word "society" because we are talking about society in general, not a specific society.
the possessive form of "forest" is spelled with an apostrophe s ('s) to show ownership or belonging. in this case, the apostrophe and s were missing, resulting in an incorrect possessive form "forest'view."
1. the error in using "length" instead of "lengths" is a grammatical mistake in pluralizing the noun "length". the correct form should be "lengths" to refer to multiple great extents.
2. the error in using "shorter" instead of "short" is a grammatical mistake in comparing the length of words. since the focus is on making words brief, the correct form should be "short" instead of the comparative "shorter".
1. error explanation: "dignosis" is a misspelling of "diagnosis," which refers to the identification of a disease or condition through examination of symptoms and test results.
2. error explanation: "seconly" is not a word in the english language. the correct word is "secondly," which is an adverb used to introduce a second point or reason.
1. error explanation: the phrase "a discovery under an accidental case" does not accurately convey the definition of serendipity. the correction "the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery" more clearly explains the concept of serendipity as an unintentional discovery or fortunate accident.
2. error explanation: the incorrect use of punctuation ", and" is replaced with the correct preposition "in" to properly connect the two clauses in the sentence.
the error here is using "a" instead of "the" before "better habit". "the" is used to refer to something specific, in this case, the habit being referred to.

2. error: arise, correction: acquire
explanation: the error here is using "arise" instead of "acquire" after "they will". "acquire" is the correct verb to use in this context to show that they will develop or form a better habit. 

3. error: better, correction: better
explanation: there is no error with the word "better" in this sentence.
the error occurred because the sentence is referring to a general result, so "a" should be used instead of "the."

2. error: result is needed, correction: telling the genetic testing result is needed
explanation: there was a missing verb in the original sentence, which was added in the correction to make the sentence grammatically correct.
the error is in subject-verb agreement. in this case, "support" should be used instead of "supports" because it needs to agree with the singular verb "must be provided."

2. error: standing of, correction: standing at
explanation: the correct preposition to use is "at" instead of "of" when referring to a specific location or junction. 

3. error: whether should him/her to, correction: whether he/she should
explanation: the pronoun "him/her" should be replaced with "he/she" to make the sentence grammatically correct and use the correct subject pronoun. 

4. error: inform the relatives, correction: inform relatives
explanation: the article "the" should be removed before "relatives" to make the sentence sound more natural and grammatically correct.
1. error: the article "a" should be removed before "research" because it is referring to research in a general sense, not a specific instance of research. 
2. error: the article "the" should be removed before "facebook" because it is a proper noun and does not require an article. 
3. error: the article "the" should be removed before "users" because it is referring to users in general, not specific users.
the error is in using "to" instead of "of" after the word "risk." in this context, "risk of have it" is the correct phrase to indicate the level of risk other family members have.

2. error: equally, correction: equal
explanation: the error is in using "equally" instead of "equal." the correct phrase is "equal risk" to show that all family members have a similar level of risk of inheriting the genetic disorder.
1. error: the singular form "computer" should be pluralized to "computers" to match the plural noun "devices."
explanation: the sentence is referring to multiple devices, so the noun "computer" should be pluralized.

2. error: the singular form "laptop" should be pluralized to "laptops" to match the plural noun "devices."
explanation: just like with "computer," "laptop" should be pluralized to match the plural noun "devices."

3. error: the singular form "tablet" should be pluralized to "tablets" to match the plural noun "devices."
explanation: the sentence is listing multiple examples of devices, so "tablet" should be pluralized.

4. error: the article "the" is missing before the word "internet."
explanation: in english, the word "the" is typically used before nouns to specify which one is being referred to.

5. error: the verb "did" should be changed to "do" to match the subject "phone" and to be in present tense.
explanation: the sentence is in present tense, so the verb should also be in present tense to ensure subject-verb agreement.
1. the erroneous sentence has two extra commas (,) which are not necessary and disrupt the flow of the sentence.

1. the error is the unnecessary word "with" before "the existence of social media sites." this word does not belong in the sentence and should be removed for clarity and accuracy.
2. the error is the subject-verb agreement between "social media sites" (plural) and "has reduced" (singular). the verb should be "has" to match the singular subject "the existence."
1. error: the correct preposition to use in this context is "on" instead of "of" when referring to frequent usage and reliance on social media and the internet.
2. error: the article "the" should be omitted before "social media" to make the sentence grammatically correct.
the error here is a missing preposition. "with" should be used after the word "provides" to correctly show the relationship between social media and people.
the error is the unnecessary use of the definite article "the" before "interpersonal skills." in this case, "interpersonal skills" is a general concept referring to a broad range of skills used in communication, so the article "the" should be omitted.
the error is a missing article "a" before the word "need". the correct sentence requires the article to make the sentence grammatically correct.
the error is missing the article "the" before "time." this is needed to specify which time is being referred to, as opposed to time in general.
1. error: "lesser", correction: "less"
   explanation: the word "lesser" is a comparative adjective used when comparing two things. in this case, "less" should be used instead to indicate a smaller amount.

2. error: "the", correction: (no change needed)
   explanation: the word "the" is not necessary before "china" in this context. it should be omitted for clarity and grammatical correctness.
the error is using a comma before the word "the" instead of "the" itself . the article "the" is used before "latest news and updates" to specify that it refers to specific news and updates, not general ones.

explanation: the error is capitalizing the word "click" when it should be in lowercase since it is not a proper noun.

   explanation: the word "the" is unnecessary and should be removed to make the sentence grammatically correct.

2. error: incorrect word choice "invading" instead of "safeguarding"

3. error: extra word "the" before "human privacy"
   explanation: the word "the" is unnecessary and should be removed to make the sentence grammatically correct.
1. the error is using "genetic" instead of "genes". "genetic" is an adjective referring to genes or heredity, while "genes" is the correct noun form in this sentence.
2. the error is using "gene" instead of "genes". since the sentence is referring to multiple genes passed down to boys, the plural form "genes" should be used.

2. error: the article "the" is unnecessary before "social media" in this context.
the error is in the verb tense. "passed" is past tense, while "passes" is present tense. since the sentence is referring to a general truth that applies to the present, the correct form is "passes".

explanation: a comma is needed to separate the two independent clauses in the sentence - "we may have more 'friends' on the list" and "but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined".

5. the error "do" should be corrected to "not" to form the negative "may not" instead of "may do not" which is grammatically incorrect.

2. error: none
explanation: no other errors were found in the erroneous sentence.
the error is the unnecessary use of the article "the" before "society." in this context, "society" should be used without the article "the."

2. error: the verb "has" should be changed to "have" to agree with the plural subject "humans."
1. the error here is the missing "the" before "internet". this is necessary to indicate a specific internet connection.
2. the error here is the use of "her" instead of "his". since the sentence is referring to the subject's daughter, it should use "his" instead of "her" to show possession.

2. error: missing comma after "social media", correction: add comma after "social media"
explanation: a comma should be used before the conjunction "regardless" when connecting two independent clauses in a sentence. in this case, the independent clause after "social media" should be separated by a comma.
1. error: subject-verb agreement error. the subject "advantages" is plural, so the verb should be "come" instead of "comes".

3. error: preposition error. the correct preposition to use when referring to accessing something on smartphones is "on", not "in".
the error is in subject-verb agreement. "checks" should be used instead of "check" to match the plural noun "checks" with the verb "do".

2. error explanation: the article "the" is missing before the word "internet" to specify which internet is being referred to.
1. error: the erroneous sentence is missing the article "the" before "engineering". this article is needed to refer to the specific concept of "engineering design process".

3. error: the word "on" is unnecessary and creates awkward phrasing. it should be removed to improve the sentence structure.
4. error: the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear and vague. it should be replaced with a more specific term or explanation to accurately convey the intended meaning.
the error is in the use of "get" instead of "put." in this context, the correct verb to use is "put" as it implies causing someone to be in a dangerous situation rather than simply obtaining a result.
the error is in using "lost" instead of "loss." "lost" is the past tense of "lose," while "loss" is the noun form that should be used in this sentence to convey the idea of losing something, in this case, interpersonal skills.

2. error: missing comma after "in turn," correction: no error
explanations: there is no error in missing a comma after "in turn" in this sentence. the use of a comma after "in turn" is optional and depends on the writer's style.

3. the error here is the unnecessary use of "the" before "small children". the correction removes the article to make the phrasing more concise and natural.
the error here is a missing comma before the word "which" to separate the introductory phrase from the rest of the sentence. the comma is needed for correct punctuation.

explanations: no error in preposition. 

3. error: social medias, correction: social media
explanations: the term "social media" is a collective noun and does not need to be pluralized.
1. error: the unnecessary article "the" before "face-to-face human contacts" is incorrect because "contacts" is being used as a mass noun in this context.
2. error: the plural form "contacts" should be singular "contact" to match the singular noun "importance" and maintain subject-verb agreement.
1. error: the use of "a" before "research" is unnecessary because "research" is an uncountable noun in this context. 
explanation: "research" is an uncountable noun and does not require an article like "a" before it.

explanation: when referring to a specific brand, product, or company like facebook, the article "the" is not needed before it.
using "but" in this context creates a contrast between neglecting people surrounding him or her and communicating with friends on facebook, which is not the intended meaning. "and" is the proper conjunction to use in this sentence to show that neglecting others and communicating with friends on facebook are both possibilities.
the error is using the plural form "dinners" instead of the singular form "dinner" because it should refer to a single meal being eaten by the family.

2. error: their holding, correction: holding
explanations: the error is adding "their" before "holding," which makes the sentence grammatically incorrect. this is because the possessive pronoun "their" is not needed in this context.

3. error: is holding, correction: when the other hand is holding
explanations: the error is missing the word "is" before "holding" in the phrase "when the other hand is holding a fork." adding "is" makes the sentence clearer and more grammatically correct.
the error is the incorrect plural form of "dilemma." in the erroneous sentence, "dilemma" is singular when it should be plural to match the plural subject "more family-related ethical." 

2. error: n/a
explanations: there are no other errors in the erroneous sentence besides the incorrect form of "dilemma."
the error is in subject-verb agreement. in this sentence, "wife" is singular, so the verb "gives" should also be singular to match.
the error is a singular vs plural noun mistake. "site" should be pluralized to "sites" to match with the plural subject "social network sites."
the error is in the word "time" which should be pluralized to "times" because "hard times" implies multiple instances of difficulties, not just one.
1. the error is the unnecessary use of "on" after the word "chatting." explanation: "chatting on the internet" is a complete phrase on its own without the preposition "on" before it.
2. the error is the singular form of "skill" instead of the plural form "skills." explanation: "interpersonal skills" refers to a combination of different abilities, hence it should be in plural form.

2. the error is in using the singular form "parent" instead of the plural form "parents". since the children refer to more than one parent, the correct form should be "parents".
the error here is a subject-verb agreement mistake. "implications" is the subject of the sentence and should be followed by the singular verb "cause" instead of the gerund "causing."

2. error: missing comma after "implications"
explanations: 
a comma is needed after "implications" to separate the introductory phrase "and thus."
the error was the unnecessary use of "the" before "innovators." it should be removed because it is not needed in this context.
the error is using "the burden" instead of "a burden." the word "a" is used to refer to a non-specific burden, while "the" is used to refer to a specific burden. in this case, since the burden is not specific, "a burden" should be used.
the error occurred because "newspaper" is a location where the story was found, so we use the preposition "in" to indicate location.

2. error: missing article "the"
explanation: the word "the" should be included before "newspaper" to indicate a specific newspaper that the real story was found in.
error: the word "if" is unnecessary in this context.
explanation: the word "if" implies a condition or uncertainty, but in this sentence, it is not needed as the engineer is simply deciding if the method agrees with existing international laws.

explanation: the word "innovators" is a general term referring to any innovator or group of innovators, so the article "the" should be omitted in this case.
the error in this sentence is the unnecessary use of the word "the" before "society." in this context, "society" is being used in a general sense, so the article "the" should be removed to make the sentence grammatically correct.
1. the error is using the indefinite article "a" before the singular noun "certain disease" instead of "the". "a" is used when referring to any one of multiple items, while "the" is used when specifying a particular item.
2. the error is using the word "altitudes" instead of "attitudes". "altitudes" refers to heights or elevations, while "attitudes" refers to opinions, feelings, or behaviors.
3. the error is using "caring us" instead of "caring for us". the correct phrase is "caring for us", which means showing concern and kindness towards someone.
in this case, the error was the use of the word "the" before "people's privacy" breaking the grammar rule of using an article 'the' before a noun. the correction removes the article to make the sentence grammatically correct.
the error is a misspelling of the word "restrict." the correct spelling is needed for clarity and proper understanding of the sentence.

2. error: confusion, correction: confusion
explanations: the error is a missing letter "t" in the word "confusion." the correct spelling is needed for accuracy in the sentence.
the error in this sentence is the incorrect plural form of "status." the correct plural form is "statuses." 

2. error: missing comma before "at school", correction: add a comma before "at school"
explanation: a comma is needed before "at school" to separate the phrases "at school", "at work", and "at home."
1. the error is the unnecessary comma after "offered him", as a comma should not be used here. it should be "offered him ¥100,000 encouraging him to stay for another year in the secondary school for the next year's ncee".
2. the error is missing the word "the" before "secondary school", making the sentence grammatically incorrect. it should be "stay for another year in the secondary school" instead of "stay for another year in secondary school".
3. the error is the missing number "1" after "top", which should be "top 1 student in his province" to clarify the student's ranking.
in this case, the error is using the verb "are" instead of "have." since the correct sentence is in the present perfect tense, "have" should be used as the helping verb.
1. the preposition "in" is unnecessary in this context. 
2. the word "life" should be pluralized to "lives" to match the plural subject "negative effects". 
3. the word "effect" should be pluralized to "effects" to match the plural subject "negative".
immediate is an adjective, while immediately is an adverb and is needed in this sentence to modify the verb "disseminate." 

2. error: no other errors
1. error: the verb "bond" should be in its base form to match the subject "people." 
explanation: subject-verb agreement error.

2. error: the singular noun "human" should be pluralized to "humans" to match the plural subject "people."
explanation: subject-verb agreement error.

3. error: the verb "live" should be in its base form to match the subject "people."
explanation: subject-verb agreement error.

4. error: the singular noun "aids" should be changed to the singular form "aid" to match the singular verb "helps."

explanation: the error in the erroneous sentence is the unnecessary use of the definite article "the" before "genetic testing". it is more accurate to say "genetic testing" without the article "the" in this context.
1. the error is in subject-verb agreement. since "groups" is the subject of the sentence, the verb "are" should be used instead of "is" to match the plural form of the subject.
2. the error is that the noun "group" should be pluralized to "groups" to match the plural form of the subject and the verb.
1. error: the erroneous sentence uses "thousand" instead of "thousands" which is incorrect as it should be in the plural form to indicate multiple genetic risk diseases.
2. error: the erroneous sentence uses "helps" instead of "help" which is incorrect as the verb should be in its singular form to match the subject "associations".
3. error: the erroneous sentence uses "supports" instead of "support" which is incorrect as the verb should be in its singular form to match the subject "all help".
4. error: the erroneous sentence uses "needs" instead of "need" which is incorrect as the verb should be in its plural form to match the subject "patients".
1. error: the word "create" is incorrect because in this context, the focus should be on using existing materials, not on creating new ones.
2. error: the article "a" is unnecessary before the word "better material" in this context.
3. error: the article "the" is unnecessary before the word "buildings" in this context.
4. error: the word "despite" is incorrect as it implies a contradiction. the word "during" is more appropriate to show that the material is being used to support buildings in the event of natural disasters.
5. error: the word "disaster" should be pluralized to "disasters" to match the plural form of "natural disasters" in the sentence.
the error here is a lack of subject-verb agreement. "devices" should be plural to match the plural subject "auto correction software."

2. error: until, correction: that
explanation: "until" is used to denote a specific time or event. in this case, "that" should be used to connect the two clauses and make the sentence clearer. this helps to show the cause and effect relationship between the effectiveness of auto correction software and the realization of the importance of writing.
