Erroneous sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .

Explanations:
1. "Contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. When used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.

Erroneous sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .

Explanations:
1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".

Erroneous sentence: Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed .

Explanations:
1. The sentence is mentioning one specific decision, i.e., the correct one, so use the definite article, "the".

Erroneous sentence: Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .

cleaned: 1. "Contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. When used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: For example, five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than five percent of the population in the China.

1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."

Correct sentence: For example, five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than five percent of the population in China.

Erroneous sentence: These green house gases are the main cause to worldwide global warming which give rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc.

1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.

Correct sentence
cleaned: 1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Error_sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct_sentence: One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Incorrect conjugation. "Expressing themselves" is the third person singular, so use "becomes" to correspond with it.

The original sentence uses the verb "become" in the plural form, which is incorrect because "expressing themselves" is a singular subject. The correct verb form is "becomes", which agrees with the subject.

2. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner. A meal is still referred to in the singular when it is shared by multiple people. Therefore, it should be "having dinner" rather than "having dinners."

The original sentence uses the plural form "dinners", which is incorrect because a family of four is having one shared meal. The correct form is the singular "dinner".

3. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "restrict".

The original sentence has a typo, using the incorrect spelling "restric" instead of the correct spelling "restrict".

4. The sentence mentions multiple people, so "life" should be pluralised, as there are multiple lives.

The original sentence uses the singular form "life", which is incorrect because it refers to multiple people. The
cleaned: 1. Incorrect conjugation. "Expressing themselves" is the third person singular, so use "becomes" to correspond with it.
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.

Error in sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .

Correct sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring some negative effects on our daily lives .

Explanation: The phrase "bring in" is unnecessary in this sentence, and "bring" alone is sufficient to convey the intended meaning.

2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.

Error in sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .

Correct sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring some negative effects on our daily lives .

Explanation: The sentence is discussing the impact of social media on people's daily lives in general, so the word "life" should be pluralised to "lives" to maintain consistency

Correct sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .

Explanation 1: The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.

Explanation 2: "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.

Erroneous sentence: I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .
Correct sentence: I noticed a real story in newspaper years ago .
Explanation:
1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".

Erroneous sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Correct sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spending too much time on the internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .

When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.

cleaned: 1. Missing article. As you are talking specifically about the next generation, use the definite article, "the".
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.

Erroneous sentence: I do not agree on this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .

Correct sentence: I do not agree with this statement that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .

Explanation:
1. If you "agree on" something it usually means you reach a compromise with someone. When talking about an opinion and saying whether you agree or disagree, "agree" is usually followed by the preposition "with".

Correct sentence: In conclusion , social media in contemporary society is able to help one improve relationships and make new friends , as well as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
Explanations:
1. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.
2. When referencing relationships as a general concept, the plural "relationships" should be used because it references multiple relationships between many different people. The singular "relationship" is used to refer to individual relationships, with "a relationship" meaning any relationship and "the relationship" meaning one relationship specifically.

Erroneous sentence: For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences:

1. Human has their own rights and privacy.
The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".

2. This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa.
The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have." While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.

3. Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced
cleaned: 1. Human has their own rights and privacy.

1. Erroneous sentence: Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Correct sentence: Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Explanation: This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need. There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.

Erroneous sentence: In addition, privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place.

1. This sentence is talking about privacy issues in general, so "issue" should be pluralised.

Explanation: The error is that "issue" is a singular noun, but the sentence is referring to multiple privacy issues, so it should be pluralized to "issues".

Erroneous sentence: Also, according to a research, it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people's lives.

1. "Research" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

Explanation: The error is that "a research" is incorrect because "research" is an uncountable noun, which means it cannot be counted or quantified. It should be used without an article.

Erroneous sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .

1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."

Correct sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Explanation: The error is in the verb tense. The sentence starts with "today", which implies a current condition, but the verb "claimed" is in the past tense, implying that the teenagers no longer say this. To fix the error, the verb should be in the present tense, "claim".

Correct_sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers from making more effort to do research and design , and they have little motivation to work hard .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences:

Erroneous sentence: These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones .

1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "come" to go with "advantages".

Correct sentence: These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones .

2. The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.

3. We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".

Erroneous sentence: Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .

1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.

2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection
cleaned: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "come" to go with "advantages".
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."

Erroneous sentence: Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is more easier than asking people around in real life .
Correct sentence: Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is easier than asking people around in real life .
Explanation: "More" is never used with "easier" because "easier" already contains the sense of it being "more". This is because "easier" implies a comparison or a degree of difficulty, and "more" is redundant in this context.

Erroneous sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Explanation: The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B. Additionally, the subject is "children," which is plural, so the object "parents" should also be plural.

Erroneous sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Correct sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking
cleaned: 
Label: 1. As "permission" is something granted by another person, this is already taken for granted without needing to explicitly say "other's". 
2. You should explicitly state "technology" for clarity.
3. An implant goes inside the body, so you need to use "in" accordingly.

Erroneous sentence: The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .

Correct sentence: The earlier we tell them , the better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .

Explanation: The construction "the earlier A, the better B" is talking about specifics, with a greater focus on B. As such, B requires an article, and as you are talking about something specific, you should use the definite article, "the".

Erroneous sentence: Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .

Correct sentence: Although surveillance technology is an issue in safeguarding human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .

Explanation 1: This sentence is talking about surveillance technology in general and therefore does not need an article.

Explanation 2: None (no other error)

Explanation 3: The sentence is discussing human privacy in general, so it does not require an article.

2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. The error "on to" is incorrect. The correct phrase is "on the current one", which refers to the current process.
4. The phrase "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds". Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. The correct phrase should be changed to something like "what others desire".

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .

1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
3. This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.

Erroneous sentence: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .

1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An

Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "transfer" to the past participle "transferred."




Error_sentence: Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
Correct_sentence: Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. The erroneous sentence is: Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .

Explanation: The error is due to incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right". This is because the right to know the healthiness of one's child is a universal right, not a specific right exclusive to the parents.

2. The erroneous sentence is: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .

Explanation: The error is due to the unnecessary use of the definite article "the" before the word "society". The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society, instead of the concept in general.

3. The erroneous sentence is: More and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life .

Explanation: The error is due to the lack of the definite article "the" before the word "Internet". When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article

2. The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.

Erroneous sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .
Correct sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation , particularly small children who are studying in nursery .
Explanations:
1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.
2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own.
3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.

Erroneous sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Explanations:
1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."

3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.
Label: 1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.

This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."

2. If China can come up with effective policy to change its education system and stimulate innovation, China's pace to flourish may become even faster.

The noun "policy" requires either an article or pluralization. The definite article "the" refers to a specific policy, especially one that was mentioned earlier in the text. Because no such policy was mentioned, it should be changed to the indefinite article "a," which refers to one single unspecified policy out of multiple potential policies, or alternately to the plural "policies," which means multiple unspecified policies.

1. Erroneous sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?

Correct sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger ?

Explanation: The error is in the verb "get". The correct verb to use in this context is "put", which means to cause someone to be in a particular situation or state. "Get" is a more general verb that can mean to obtain or acquire something, but it doesn't fit the context of causing someone to be in danger.

2. Erroneous sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Correct sentence: Therefore , the lack of creative human resources seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .

Explanation: The error is in the adjective "qualified". The phrase "human resource" refers to a group of people, and "qualified" is not necessary to describe a group of people. Additionally, "qualified" typically refers to official or certified qualifications, such as tests, which is not relevant to creative thinking abilities.

cleaned: 1. Erroneous sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.

Error: Human has their own rights and privacy .
Correction: Humans have their own rights and privacy .

Explanation: The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised to "humans" to match the subject-verb agreement.

2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".

Error: Human has their own rights and privacy .
Correction: Humans have their own rights and privacy .

Explanation: Since the subject is "humans" (plural), the verb "have" should be in the third person plural form "have" to match the subject-verb agreement.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. This sentence is talking about both parents having gene A, so the verb "has" should be pluralised to "have" to agree with the subject "both of his parents".
2. The phrase "at high risk" is more commonly used than "under high risk". "At" is a more idiomatic preposition to use in this context.
3. The sentence is suggesting that running two separate tests would be unnecessary because the parents already know they are at high risk of having disease C. The phrase "know that he has the gene Aa" is unclear, as it seems to be referring to the person being tested, but the context is about the parents. It's likely that the author meant to write "know that he is at high risk of having disease C" or something similar.

Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."

Erroneous sentence: Thirdly, social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world, all with a click away on the refresh button.

* Missing article: The error is the lack of the definite article "the" before the phrase "latest news and updates". This is because "the world" is a specific, countable noun, and "latest news and updates" is a specific type of news, so "the" is needed to specify which news is being referred to.

2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.

Correct_sentence: In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees to spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. The erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .

Error: The conjunction "but" is used incorrectly. The sentence should use "and" instead of "but" to introduce the second clause, which adds to the first clause rather than contrasting with it.

2. The erroneous sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .

Error: The phrase "reliance of the social media and the Internet" is incorrect. The correct phrase is "rely on" instead of "reliance of". Additionally, "social media" is an uncountable noun and should not have an article.

3. The erroneous sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .

Error: The sentence is missing the definite article "the" before "time". The sentence should read "Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone".

cleaned: 1. The erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."

Correct_sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used on the social media sites .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

Erroneous sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Explanations:
1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
2. The subject is "children," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.

Erroneous sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Correct sentence: Nevertheless , there are cyber police who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
Explanations:
1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".

Erroneous sentence: According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes which are
cleaned: 1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
2. The subject is "children," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Error_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Correct_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. The phrase "despite of the distance" is incorrect. The correct preposition to use in this context is "despite the distance". "Of" is used to indicate possession or origin, whereas "despite" is used to indicate a contrast.

Erroneous sentence: Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Correct sentence: Some genes will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Explanations:
1. The adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted.
2. The word "some" means an unspecified amount or a large amount. It is usually used with plural nouns. Also, it is unlikely that there is only one gene that can only be inherited by a specific gender, so logically it is more likely to be the plural.

Erroneous sentence: Therefore , the social media is truly good for people .
Correct sentence: Therefore , social media is truly good for people .
Explanations:
1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. The erroneous sentence: And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .

Explanation: The error is the use of the singular "gene" instead of the plural "genes". The technology can alter any and all genes, not just one, so the correct plural form is used.

2. The erroneous sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem .

Explanation: The error is the incorrect conjugation of the verb "expressing". The subject is "themselves", which is a third-person singular pronoun, so the verb should be "becomes" instead of "become".

3. The erroneous sentence: Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creat

**Erroneous sentence: According to Khandani (2005), to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes which are defining the problem, gathering pertinent information, generating possible solutions, analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it.**

* A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes" is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.

**Erroneous sentence: Recently, a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE), but he did not enter the university which he applied for, because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year's NCEE, expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province.**

Label: 1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."

Correct sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .

Explanation:
1. The error is in the phrase "the manufacture company". The correct phrase should be "the manufacturing company", as "manufacture" is a verb, and "manufacturing" is a noun.

Erroneous sentence: It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .

Correct sentence: It provides people with a more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each other.

Explanations:
1. The indefinite article "a" is used when something exists in an unspecified manner or amount, or to express one out of multiple options. The phrase "convenient contact environment" means one potential environment out of many, with varying degrees of convenience. This condition is best expressed by the indefinite article "a."

Erroneous sentence: Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .

Correct sentence: Writing is an essential skill for person who express their own feelings and opinions .

Explanations:
1. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the skill of writing) with regard to whom (a person).

But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "thoughts" should be pluralized.
2. The singular noun "personality" means a collection of traits, behaviors, or emotional qualities that make up an individual's character. The plural noun "personalities" refers to the personalities of multiple people.

Erroneous sentence: A family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .

Explanation: The error is the use of the plural "dinners" instead of the singular "dinner". A meal is still referred to in the singular when it is shared by multiple people.

Erroneous sentence: The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people .

Explanation: The error is the incorrect verb form "creat" instead of the correct form "create". The verb "create" should be in the base form when it is used as a main verb.

Erroneous sentence: However , critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .

Explanation: The errors are the unnecessary use of the word "that" and the incorrect verb form "have" instead of the correct form "has". The verb "have" is used to indicate possession or to describe a situation, but in this sentence, it is used to describe a general statement, so the verb "has

This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Erroneous sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .

2. Erroneous sentence: Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .

Erroneous sentence: This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C.

2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.

Erroneous sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .

Explanation:
1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".

Erroneous sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .

Explanation:
1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.

With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.

Correct sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .

The error is in the verb tense. The sentence is referring to a current condition, but the verb "claimed" is in the past tense, implying that the teenagers no longer say this. To correct this, the present tense "claim" should be used instead.

Erroneous sentence: Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Correct sentence: Also , according to research , it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Explanation:
The error is in the use of the indefinite article "a" before the uncountable noun "research". Additionally, the definite article "the" is used before the website name "Facebook", which is incorrect. Finally, the phrase "other people

Label: 1. The noun "policy" requires either an article or pluralization. The definite article "the" refers to a specific policy, especially one that was mentioned earlier in the text. Because no such policy was mentioned, it should be changed to the indefinite article "a," which refers to one single unspecified policy out of multiple potential policies, or alternately to the plural "policies," which means multiple unspecified policies.

Erroneous sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .

Correct sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .

Explanation: 1. Missing article. As you are talking specifically about the next generation, use the definite article, "the".

Erroneous sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .

Correct sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows .

Explanation: 1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society, instead of the concept in general.

Erroneous sentence: Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet .

Correct sentence: Not only the phone do the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computers , laptops , tablets , and many other

Label: 1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

Erroneous sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenges for the innovators .

Correct sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenge for the innovators .

Explanation:
1. The pronoun "another" means "one more," so it is singular and cannot be used with the plural "challenges." The singular "challenge" should be used instead.

Erroneous sentence: It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected .

Correct sentence: It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skills will be badly affected .

Explanation:
1. Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".
2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.

Explanation:
1. The first "be" in the sentence can be used for both "shy" and "afraid", you do not need to repeat it for "afraid".

Erroneous sentence: In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .

Correct sentence: In addition , privacy issues have become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share in the first place .

Explanation:
1. This sentence is talking about privacy issues in general, so "issue" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Privacy issues" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
3. Incorrect word. The correct expression is "in the first place".

Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences:

**Erroneous sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .**

* Error: "the more of the writing skills" is not a common phrase, and "of" is not the correct preposition to use. Additionally, "time used" is not a common phrase; instead, "time spent" or "time devoted" would be more natural.

**Erroneous sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .**

* Error 1: "stay another year" should be "stay for another year" to use the correct preposition "for" to indicate an amount of time.
* Error 2: "the secondary school" is a specific school, so the definite article "the" is correct. However, "secondary school" without an article refers to a

Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.




Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

**Erroneous sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .**

1. Unnecessary word. If you were using "in spite" it would be okay to write "in spite of the distance", but "of" is not necessary when using "despite".

**Erroneous sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .**

1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.

Correct_sentence: Writing is an essential skill for person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences:

1. Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .

Explanation: The subject "social media" is a collective noun and should be treated as singular, so the verb "does" is required for subject-verb agreement.

2. Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .

Explanation: This is a spelling error, and the correct spelling is "showing". Additionally, the noun "experience" is countable in this context, referring to specific events in people's lives, so it should be made plural to match the plural "pictures".

3. Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .

Correct_sentence: While we do know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
Prediction: Based on the given examples, I will provide explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."

In the erroneous sentence, the phrase "based on their limitations" is missing the preposition "against", which is necessary to convey the idea of treating someone unfairly based on their limitations. The correct sentence uses the preposition "against" to indicate that the discrimination is directed against the individuals with limitations.

2. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone.

Correct_sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately becomes really a big problem .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. The phrase "while" is used correctly, but the sentence is a bit awkwardly phrased. The correction uses the idiomatic phrase "once they are communicating face-to-face", which is more natural and clear.
2. The verb "become" is the correct choice because the subject "expressing themselves appropriately" is a singular noun phrase. The verb "becomes" would be used if the subject were a plural noun or a third-person singular pronoun.

Correct_sentence: More and more networking has been transferred to the internet from real life .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .

Correct sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers from making more effort to do research and design , and they have little motivation to work hard .

1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.

2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. The error is that the sentence is talking about "technology" in general, so it does not need an article. The correct sentence uses "technology" without an article, as it is a general term.

Erroneous sentence: Also, according to a research, it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people's lives.
Correct sentence: Also, according to research, it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people's lives.

Correct_sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Unnecessary word. "Seek out" does not require the preposition "for" to indicate what is being sought out.

The original sentence has an unnecessary word "for" which makes the sentence sound awkward. The corrected sentence is more concise and clear.

Error_sentence: Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue .
Correct_sentence: Here I want to share Forest 's view on this issue .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. An "s" and a space are missing. There should be an "s" after the apostrophe and "view" should be a separate word.

The original sentence is missing an "s" after the apostrophe, which is necessary to form the possessive noun "Forest's". Additionally, the word "view" is not separated from the apostrophe, making it unclear what is intended. The corrected sentence adds the missing "s" and separates the word "view" from the apostrophe, making the sentence clearer and more grammatically correct.

Error_sentence: People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
Correct_sentence: People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. From the sentence we can surmise that the people would have more than one check, so the plural "checks" should be used.

Error: The sentence uses "do additional check" instead of "do additional checks".

Explanation: The word "check" is a singular noun, but since it is used in a plural sense (more than one check), the plural form "checks" should be used.

2. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.

Error: The sentence uses "if" instead of "whether".

Explanation: The sentence is asking the engineer to decide whether a method is suitable and whether it agrees with existing laws. The word "whether" is more suitable in this context to indicate a choice between two options.

3. Missing article. As you are talking
cleaned: 1. From the sentence we can surmise that the people would have more than one check, so the plural "checks" should be used.
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".




Error_sentence: Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .
Correct_sentence: Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences:

Erroneous sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about others .

Explanation: The error is the use of the word "concurrent" which is a noun and should be replaced with the adjective "concurrent" to mean "happening or done at the same time". Additionally, the word "a knowledge" is incorrect because "knowledge" is an uncountable and abstract noun, so it cannot be made singular or plural, thus it cannot be used with the indefinite article 'a'.

Erroneous sentence: When our phones are accidentally done , we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends .

Explanation: The error is the use of the word "done" which is not the correct verb to use in this context. The correct verb would be "broken" or "damaged" to describe the accidental damage to the phone. Additionally, the error is the use of the article "the" before the uncountable noun "social media", which should be removed.

Correct sentence: Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
Explanation: The subject here is "social media," which is collective and treated as singular, so the verb should be "does" for subject-verb agreement.

Correct sentence: In addition , privacy issues have become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share in the first place .
Explanation: This sentence is talking about privacy issues in general, so "issue" should be pluralized. Additionally, the verb "has become" should be changed to "have become" to agree with the plural subject "issues". Finally, the phrase "at the first place" is incorrect and should be changed to "
cleaned: 1. Erroneous sentence: Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.

1. The error is using "thousand" as a specific number (1,000) instead of a large, unspecified amount, which should be pluralized as "thousands".
2. The error is not present in this sentence.
3. The error is not present in this sentence.

Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "As the result" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a result," which implies that the outcome is one of several.

Erroneous sentence: Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .

Correct sentence: Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .

Explanation:
1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need. There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.

Erroneous sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .

Correct sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .

Explanation:
1. "Contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. When used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.

Erroneous sentence: Or
cleaned: 1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article.

Label: 1. In the context of care and aid from other people, the word "support" is an uncountable noun and is not pluralized. It generally refers to actions or gestures, which are not tangible and cannot be counted. The word "supports" is a verb form or a noun referring to the structural components of a building that allow it to withstand force.

Prediction: I'll provide explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences.

1. One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication.

The error is that the noun "disadvantage" should be in the plural form "disadvantages" because it refers to a result of something, and it's often assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Additionally, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural. The verb "loss" should also be changed to "lose" because "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression.

2. One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication.

The error is that the phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose".

3. One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss interest of face-to-face communication.

The error is that the phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect

Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

Error_sentence: As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. The original sentence uses "but" to connect the two clauses, implying that one thing happens but not the other. However, the correct sentence uses "and" to indicate that both actions are happening simultaneously.

Erroneous sentence: In addition, with all those "nice" guys around on the social network website, one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on Facebook.

Correct sentence: In addition, with all those "nice" guys around on the social network website, one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on Facebook.

Explanations: "But" should be used in the situation where you do one thing, but not the other, so you could say, "they don't speak to the people around them, but do communicate with friends on Facebook," but in the context of your sentence, you are saying that both these actions are going on at the same time, so you should use "and", as in they shun/ignore the people around them AND only communicate with friends on Facebook.

2. The original sentence uses "or else" to introduce a hypothetical situation, but the correct sentence uses "or" to introduce an alternative.

Err
cleaned: 1. The original sentence uses "but" to connect the two clauses, implying that one thing happens but not the other. However, the correct sentence uses "and" to indicate that both actions are happening simultaneously.
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. As "risk" is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".




Error_sentence: Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet .
Correct_sentence: Not only the phone do the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computers , laptops , tablets , and many other devices which are able to connect to the internet .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. The error in the sentence is that the subject "phone" is singular, but the verb "did" is plural. To fix this, the verb should be changed to "does" to agree with the singular subject.

Erroneous sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma .
Correct sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas .
Explanations:
1. This is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. It should be the plural "dilemmas" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential ethical issues.

Erroneous sentence: That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
Correct sentence: That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
Explanations:
1. The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.

Erroneous sentence: It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connect people globally .

cleaned: 1. The error in the sentence is that the subject "phone" is singular, but the verb "did" is plural. To fix this, the verb should be changed to "does" to agree with the singular subject.
Label: 1. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and "the computer" meaning one computer specifically.
2. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing laptops as a general concept, the plural "laptops" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "laptop" is used to refer to an individual laptop, with "a laptop" meaning any laptop and "the laptop" meaning one laptop specifically.
3. The plural noun "tablet" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing tablets as a general concept, the plural "tablets" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "tablet" is used to refer to an individual tablet, with "a tablet" meaning any tablet and "the tablet" meaning one tablet specifically.
4. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.
5. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "did" implies that the phone is no longer involved in people's work, so it should be the present tense "do" instead.

Correct_sentence: Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not reflected as something positive to the users .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: With the aids of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily .

1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "bond" to go with "people".

Erroneous sentence: Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .

1. The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so use the plural "groups".
2. This connects back to "family members" at the beginning of the sentence, so you need to use the plural, "are", as in "Family members are a crucial factor...".

Erroneous sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .

1. When generally referring to a period of hardship, time is pluralised, so the correct expression is "the hard times".

Erroneous sentence: The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .

1. The construction "the earlier A, the better B" is talking about specifics, with a greater focus on B
cleaned: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "bond" to go with "people".
Label: 1. Unnecessary comma. The position of the comma is grammatically incorrect.
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "reflected".




Error_sentence: I do not agree on this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Correct_sentence: I do not agree with this statement that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. The sentence is mentioning one specific decision, i.e., the correct one, so use the definite article, "the".

In the original sentence, "a right decision" is mentioned, which implies that there is only one correct decision being referred to. To specify this, the definite article "the" is used.

2. In the corporate world, employers often block social media networks to prevent employees from spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work.

The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.

When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."

The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "sp
cleaned: 1. The sentence is mentioning one specific decision, i.e., the correct one, so use the definite article, "the".
Label: 1. If you "agree on" something it usually means you reach a compromise with someone. When talking about an opinion and saying whether you agree or disagree, "agree" is usually followed by the preposition "with".
2. Incorrect word choice. This is an opinion/assertion that is being stated, so use "statement".

Correct_sentence: However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.

Error: "internet were known"

Correction: "the internet were known"

Explanation: The error is using the indefinite article "a" instead of the definite article "the" when referring to the Internet as a noun.

2. This is the passive voice, continuing from the phrase "is recorded." The passive voice requires a form of the verb "to be" followed by a secondary verb, which is always the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "transfer" to the past participle "transferred."

Error: "Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies"

Correction: "Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transferred to the companies"

Explanation: The error is using the present tense verb "transfer" instead of the past participle "transferred" to maintain the passive voice.

3. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form
cleaned: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".

Correct_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .

1. The error is in the phrase "as one the closest group". The correct phrase should be "as one of the closest groups" because "one" is a singular noun and "groups" is a plural noun. The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so it should use the plural "groups".

Erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .

1. The error is in the use of the conjunction "but". The correct conjunction is "and". The sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.

The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so it should use the plural "groups".
Label: 1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.




Error_sentence: Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .
Correct_sentence: Social media provides people with a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences:

1. Erroneous sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about others .

Explanation: The error is the use of the indefinite article "a" before the uncountable noun "knowledge". As "knowledge" is an abstract concept, it cannot be made singular or plural, and therefore, it cannot be used with the indefinite article "a". The correct sentence uses the noun "knowledge" without the article.

2. Erroneous sentence: ...thousand of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all helps and supports from everyone...

Explanation: The error is the use of the indefinite article "a" before the uncountable noun "help". Additionally, the phrase "thousand" is used metaphorically to express a large, unspecified amount, so it should be pluralized as "thousands". The corrected sentence uses the plural form "thousands" and omits the indefinite article "a" before "help".

Erroneous sentence: I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .
Correct sentence: I noticed a real story in newspaper years ago .
Explanation:
1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read in" when the information is contained within a publication, such as a newspaper or magazine, rather than "on". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".

**Erroneous sentence: It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected.**

1. Unnecessary word. The phrase "on chatting" is redundant and can be simplified to "chatting".

**Erroneous sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows.**

1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society, instead of the concept in general.

**Erroneous sentence: Hence, social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them.**

1. Incorrect form. The adverb "immediately" should be used instead of the adjective "immediate".

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .

Explanation: The error is the use of "but" instead of "and". "But" is used to contrast two ideas, whereas "and" is used to connect two ideas that are happening simultaneously. In this sentence, the speaker is saying that someone may neglect people around them and only communicate with friends on Facebook, so "and" is the correct conjunction to use.

Erroneous sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .

Explanation: The error is the use of the singular "time" instead of the plural "times". When referring to a period of hardship, it is common to use the plural "times" to indicate that it is a repeated or ongoing experience.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences:

Erroneous sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .

1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.

2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.

3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.

Erroneous sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as
cleaned: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.
Label: 1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.

1. The sentence "Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives ." contains an error in the phrase "according to a research". The correct phrase is "according to research", because "research" is an uncountable noun and does not take the indefinite article "a".

2. The sentence contains an error in the phrase "the users". The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader, so it does not need the definite article "the".

3. The sentence contains an error in the phrase "using the Facebook". The name of the website "Facebook" is a proper noun and does not take an article in general.

Correct sentence: When electronic devices are not grounded properly , there is a probability that the user might get an electric shock when he/she accidentally comes into contact with the device .

Explanation:
1. The subject is "he/she," which is singular, so the verb should be singular for subject-verb agreement. The verb "come" should be changed to the singular form "comes" to agree with the singular subject "he/she".

Erroneous sentence: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .

Correct sentence: In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees from spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .

1. Erroneous sentence: It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes .
Correct sentence: It is also important to use better material that can support buildings during any natural disasters like earthquakes .

Explanation: The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.

2. Erroneous sentence: On one side , it is obvioualy that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Correct sentence: On one side , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives .

Explanation: This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "obvious." Also, it looks like the author intended to use the word "obviously," which is an adverb. Adverbs are used to modify verbs, but in this sentence, the word follows "it is" and therefore should be a noun.

Correct_sentence: It provides people with a more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.

 Erroneous sentence: With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life .

Correct sentence: With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each other through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important role in our life .

2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".

 Erroneous sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk

Erroneous sentence: According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .

Explanation:
1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.

Erroneous sentence: With the aids of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily .

Explanation:
1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "bond" to go with "people".
2. This sentence is talking about humans in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "live" to go with "humans".

The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.
Label: 1. The adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted.
2. The word "some" means an unspecified amount or a large amount. It is usually used with plural nouns. Also, it is unlikely that there is only one gene that can only be inherited by a specific gender, so logically it is more likely to be the plural.

Correct sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .
Explanation: "Contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article. When used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.

2. Erroneous sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
Correct sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
Explanation:
1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.

Erroneous sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
Correct sentence: The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows .
Explanation:
1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society, instead of the concept in general.

Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Erroneous sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma .
Correct sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas .

Explanation: This is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. It should be the plural "dilemmas" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential ethical issues.

2. Erroneous sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Correct sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .

Explanation: The phrase "with cash reimbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.

3. Erroneous sentence: Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet .

1. Erroneous sentence: Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
Correct sentence: Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .
Explanation: The subject is "social media", which is collective and treated as singular, so the verb should be "does" for subject-verb agreement.

2. Erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Correct sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .
Explanation: The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and", the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting

Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.

* The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralized to "applications".

Correct sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurrently has knowledge about others .

Explanations:
1. "Concurrent" is the correct word to use instead of "concurently", which is a typo. Additionally, "knowledge" is an uncountable and abstract noun, so it cannot be made singular or plural, thus it cannot be used with the indefinite article 'a'.

Error_sentence: Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
Correct_sentence: Personally I am studying oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friends .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. The phrase "I am study" is incorrect. The correct verb form should be "I am studying" to indicate that the action of studying is ongoing.
2. The word "oversea" is likely a typo and should be replaced with "abroad" or "overseas", which are more common and idiomatic ways to refer to studying outside one's home country.
3. The phrase "contact my old friend" is incorrect. The correct verb form should be "contact my old friends" to agree with the subject "I" which is singular.

4. The sentence is missing a comma after "oversea" which is necessary to separate the two independent clauses.
Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.

2. This sentence is talking about humans in general, so "human" should be pluralised to "humans".
3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "live" to go with "humans".

Erroneous sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .
Correct sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .
Explanation: This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use". Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: For example, we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us "Today is someone's birthday".

Explanation:
1. The error is the use of the indefinite article "a" with the plural noun "birthday wishes". The correct usage would be either "a birthday wish" or "birthday wishes" (without the indefinite article).

Erroneous sentence: The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people.

Explanation:
1. The error is the incorrect verb form "creat" instead of "create". The verb "create" is a regular verb that requires the base form "create" instead of the past tense "creat".

Erroneous sentence: Thus, having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts.

Explanation:
1. The error is the typo "emotinal" instead of the correct word "emotional". The word "emotional" refers to feelings or emotions, whereas "emotinal" is not a valid word.

Erroneous sentence: It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes .
Correct sentence: It is also important to use better material that can support buildings during any natural disasters like earthquakes .
Explanation:
1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.

1. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used
cleaned: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
Label: 1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.




Error_sentence: Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .
Correct_sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. The erroneous sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Correct sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Explanation: The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. In this sentence, "the time" refers to a specific period of time spent away from screens, not just any time. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.

2. The erroneous sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Correct sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Explanation: The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of innovators in general.

3. The erroneous sentence: It means that one can not know another 's real
cleaned: 1. The erroneous sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."




Error_sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
Correct_sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger ?
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. The sentence is missing an article ("a" or "the") before "manufacture company". The correct sentence uses the indefinite article "a" before "manufacture company" to refer to a specific company that is not previously mentioned.

Erroneous sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Correct sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .

2. The sentence is missing the correct conjugation of the verb "come". The verb "come" should be in the third person plural form "come" instead of "comes" to agree with the subject "advantages".

Erroneous sentence: These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones .
Correct sentence: These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones .

3. The sentence is using the singular noun "application" to refer to multiple social media applications. The correct sentence uses the plural noun "
cleaned: 1. The sentence is missing an article ("a" or "the") before "manufacture company". The correct sentence uses the indefinite article "a" before "manufacture company" to refer to a specific company that is not previously mentioned.
Label: 1. The phrase "put in danger" is a common expression and the verb does not change. The verb "put" means to cause someone to be in a particular place or position.




Error_sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people .
Correct_sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. The erroneous sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .

Error: The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of to innovators in general.

Explanation: The error is in the phrase "the innovators are working for". The definite article "the" is not necessary here, as "innovators" is a general concept. The correct sentence uses "innovators" without the definite article.

2. The erroneous sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .

Error: The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.

Explanation: The error is in the phrase "the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone". The definite article "the" is not
cleaned: 1. The erroneous sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Label: 1. The verb "cause" is always followed by a noun, and "lost" is the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed to the noun "loss." 




Error_sentence: These green house gases are the main cause to worldwide global warming which give rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Correct_sentence: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .

Correct sentence: And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering genes is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .

Explanation:
1. The technology to alter genetic material could be applied not just to a single gene but any and all genes. For that reason, it's correct to use the plural "genes" rather than the singular "gene."

Erroneous sentence: In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .

Correct sentence: In past decades , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even a letter .

Explanation:
1. The concept of "past decades"
cleaned: 1. The technology to alter genetic material could be applied not just to a single gene but any and all genes. For that reason, it's correct to use the plural "genes" rather than the singular "gene."
Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.




Error_sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
Correct_sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Erroneous sentence: Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
Correct sentence: Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences .

Explanation: This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."

2. Erroneous sentence: That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
Correct sentence: That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .

Explanation: The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.

3. Erroneous sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .
Correct sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers from making more effort to do research and design , and they have little motivation to work hard .

Explanation: The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply
cleaned: 1. Erroneous sentence: Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
Label: 1. The statement is confusing two phrases: "keep confidential" and "in confidence." The phrase "keep confidential" is common and is used without variation in wording.

Correct_sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

Erroneous sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .

Explanation: The error is that "research" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralized as "researches". Additionally, the subject is "research", which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.

Erroneous sentence: For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .

Explanation: The error is that the indefinite article "a" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "birthday wishes". Either "birthday wishes" or "a birthday wish" would be acceptable.

Erroneous sentence: Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .

Explanation: The errors are that the adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted. Additionally, the word "some" means an unspecified amount or a large amount, and it is usually used with plural nouns, so "some genes" would be
cleaned: 
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .

Explanation:
1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".

Erroneous sentence: People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .

Explanation:
1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "short
cleaned: 1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".
Label: 1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.
2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own.
3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.

Prediction: I'll provide explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence.

1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.

The correction adds a comma before the non-restrictive clause "which are... implementing it", making the sentence grammatically correct.

Correct sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance of carrying certain disease .

Explanation:
1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".

Erroneous sentence: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .

Correct sentence: In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees from spending their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .

cleaned: 1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.

2. This sentence is either referring to the parents of specific children, or parents and children in general, but either way, "parents" should be pluralised.
Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner.

Error_sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma .
Correct_sentence: This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Incorrect preposition. As "risk" is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".

In the erroneous sentence: "As many people realize, a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier's relatives, that is, one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it, so this problem should be treated seriously by the family."

The error is in the phrase "at risk to have it". The correct phrase should be "at risk of having it", where "of" is used to indicate the possibility of having the genetic disorder.

2. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the skill of writing) with regard to whom (a person).

In the erroneous sentence: "Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions."

The error is in the phrase "an essential skill of person". The correct phrase should be "an essential skill for person", where "for" is used to indicate the purpose or benefit of having the skill of writing.

Correct sentence: It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skills will be badly affected .

Error_sentence: With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network site now become a place to show off .
Correct_sentence: With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network sites now become a place to show off .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. The subject-verb agreement error: The subject "people" is a plural noun, so the verb "willing" should be changed to "will" to agree with the subject.
2. The error in the phrase "to become the best among others": The phrase "to become the best among others" is a comparative phrase, and it should be followed by a singular noun "site" instead of "sites". However, the correct sentence uses the plural form "sites" to refer to multiple social network sites.
3. The error in the phrase "social network site now become": The verb tense is incorrect. The sentence should use the present tense "become" instead of the past tense "become".
4. The error in the phrase "a place to show off": The phrase "a place" is incorrect because it implies a specific place, whereas the intended meaning is a general concept. The correct phrase "a place to show off" should be replaced with a more general phrase such as "a platform to showcase oneself".

Overall, the errors in this sentence are related to subject-verb agreement, verb tense, and phrase structure.
cleaned: 1. The subject-verb agreement error: The subject "people" is a plural noun, so the verb "willing" should be changed to "will" to agree with the subject.
2. The error in the phrase "to become the best among others": The phrase "to become the best among others" is a comparative phrase, and it should be followed by a singular noun "site" instead of "sites". However, the correct sentence uses the plural form "sites" to refer to multiple social network sites.
3. The error in the phrase "social network site now become": The verb tense is incorrect. The sentence should use the present tense "become" instead of the past tense "become".
4. The error in the phrase "a place to show off": The phrase "a place" is incorrect because it implies a specific place, whereas the intended meaning is a general concept. The correct phrase "a place to show off" should be replaced with a more general phrase such as "a platform to showcase oneself".
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about social network sites in general, so "site" should be pluralised.

Erroneous sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .

Explanation:
1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.

Erroneous sentence: In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
Correct sentence: In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .

Explanation:
1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Interpersonal skills" is the third person plural, so use "are" to correspond with it.

Correct sentence: A family of four having dinner
cleaned: 1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
Label: 1. When generally referring to a period of hardship, time is pluralised, so the correct expression is "the hard times".




Error_sentence: It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected .
Correct_sentence: It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skills will be badly affected .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. As "risk" is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of". (From the first erroneous sentence)

In the sentence "one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder", the correct preposition to use after "risk" is "of", not "for". "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a goal, whereas "of" is used to indicate a possibility or a probability.

2. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research". (From the second erroneous sentence)

The word "research" is an uncountable noun, meaning it cannot be counted or quantified. As such, it is not necessary to use the plural form "researches". Instead, use the singular form "research" to refer to the study or investigation.

3. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it. (From the second erroneous sentence
cleaned: 1. As "risk" is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of". (From the first erroneous sentence)
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".
2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.




Error_sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct_sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. The error is in the preposition "rely the". The correct preposition is "on", which indicates reliance or dependence on something. "Rely the" is not a grammatically correct phrase and implies that the children are relying on the process of living, which doesn't make sense.

The corrected sentence "The children rely on the parents to live" means that the children rely on their parents for their survival or well-being.
cleaned: 1. The error is in the preposition "rely the". The correct preposition is "on", which indicates reliance or dependence on something. "Rely the" is not a grammatically correct phrase and implies that the children are relying on the process of living, which doesn't make sense.
Label: 1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
2. The subject is "children," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.

Erroneous sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .

Correct sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal moral morals the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .

Explanation:
1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."

Erroneous sentence: On one

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".

Erroneous sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease .
Correct sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance of carrying certain disease .

2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.

Erroneous sentence: Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .

Correct sentence: Personally I feel more at ease on social media .
Explanations:
1. "Media" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralised.

Erroneous sentence: Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Correct sentence: Also , according to research , it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Explanations:
1. "Research" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. This sentence is talking about users in general and therefore should not have an article.
3. "Facebook" is a proper noun and therefore should not have an article.

Correct sentence: In addition , privacy issues have become more popular nowadays since some people
cleaned: 1. "Media" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralised.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences:

1. The erroneous sentence: Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .

Error: The definite article "the" can imply a comparison. The phrase "the engineering process" implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks "the engineering process" as being distinct from those other processes.

2. Error: The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.

3. Error: As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."

4. Error: The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it

Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".




Error_sentence: Looking at this third step we realize why the second stage of an engineering design process of gathering information is important.Once all the information is put together into the different possible solutions , the engineer is put to decide which method out of the lot is suited best for the purpose and if agrees with existing international laws .

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. The phrase "do the jobs" is incorrect because it is in the past tense, implying that the phone is no longer involved in people's work. Instead, the correct phrase "do the jobs" is in the present tense, indicating that the phone is still involved in people's work.
2. The list "devices like personal computer, laptop, tablet, and many other devices" is plural, so the adjective "many" should be plural as well. Additionally, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types.
3. The list "devices like personal computer, laptop, tablet, and many other devices" is plural, so the adjective "many" should be plural as well. Additionally, when referencing laptops as a general concept, the plural "laptops" should be used because it references multiple types.

Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.




Error_sentence: These are not the only challenges that the innovators are going to deal with .
Correct_sentence: These are not the only challenges that innovators are going to deal with .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. The erroneous sentence is missing the definite article "the" before "time". The sentence is referring to a specific time spent away from the computer screen or mobile phone, not just any time. The definite article "the" is used to specify which time is being referred to.

Erroneous sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Correct sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .

2. The erroneous sentence has an unnecessary possessive adjective "other's" which is redundant and makes the sentence awkward. The sentence should simply use the word "permission" without the possessive adjective. Additionally, the sentence should explicitly state "technology" for clarity. Finally, the preposition "in" should be used instead of "to" to indicate that the technology is being implanted inside someone's body.

Erroneous sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other 's permission , this should not be placed or implanted to anyone .
Correct sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without permission , this technology should not be placed or implanted in anyone .

1. Erroneous sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
Correct sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
Explanation: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.
Explanation: 2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
Explanation: 3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences:

1. Erroneous sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .

Error: The phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not grammatically correct, and the sentence is trying to convey a causal relationship between time spent on social media and reduced writing skills.

Explanation: The sentence should be rephrased to use a more common construction, such as "the more time spent on social media, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." This construction uses the correct preposition "on" instead of "in", and makes it clear that time spent on social media is the cause of reduced writing skills.

2. Erroneous sentence: Also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .

Error: The sentence has three errors: "research" is an uncountable noun and should not have an article, "Facebook" is a proper noun and should not have an article, and the sentence is trying to convey a general truth about users in general.

Explanation:
cleaned: 1. Erroneous sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .
Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.

2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.

3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province.

Explanation: The error is in the phrase "under high risk of". The correct phrase is "at high risk of", as "at" is the typical preposition used to indicate being in a particular state or condition.

"Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".

Erroneous sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .

* Add a comma to separate the clauses.

* This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.

Erroneous sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of the face-to-face human contacts has decresed .

* "Contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
* When used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.

Erroneous sentence: That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .

* The subject of the statement is "that," which

4. "Aid" used in the sense of help or assistance is an uncountable noun and therefore should not be pluralised.




Error_sentence: We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
Correct_sentence: We can not deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. The sentence "We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem" is missing a negation word "do" before "not". The correct sentence should be "We cannot deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem".

The error is that the sentence is using the phrase "We can not" which is not a correct negation phrase in English. The correct negation phrase is "We cannot".

Note: This error is not present in the original list of examples, I assume it was an additional sentence for me to explain.
cleaned: 1. The sentence "We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem" is missing a negation word "do" before "not". The correct sentence should be "We cannot deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem".
Label: 1. The concept of "genetic testing" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific type or instance of genetic testing, instead of the concept in general.




Error_sentence: Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
Correct_sentence: Family members , as one the closest groups of people from whom they can get comfort , are a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

Erroneous sentence: As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .

Explanation:
The error is in the use of "the" instead of "a". "As the result" implies that there is only one possible outcome, whereas "as a result" implies that one of several outcomes is being referred to. In this case, "a result" is the correct choice because there may be multiple genetic testing results.

Erroneous sentence: Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .

Explanation:
The errors are in the spelling of "Secondly" (should be "Secondly" with a capital "S") and "dignosis" (should be "diagnosis"). "Secondly" is an adverb that indicates the second point being made, and "diagnosis" is the correct term for the process of identifying a disease or condition.

Erroneous sentence: That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .

Explanation:
The error is in the use of the plural noun "elements" to describe a singular concept. The subject of the sentence

Label: 1. The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so use the plural "groups".
2. This connects back to "family members" at the beginning of the sentence, so you need to use the plural, "are", as in "Family members are a crucial factor...".

Erroneous sentence: If your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .

Correct sentence: If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .

1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "gives" to go with "wife".

Erroneous sentence: Not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet .

Correct sentence: Not only the phone do the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computers , laptops , tablets , and many other devices which are able to connect to the internet .

Explanations:
1. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and

2. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
3. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
4. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.




Error_sentence: It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes .
Correct_sentence: It is also important to use better material that can support buildings during any natural disasters like earthquakes .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: Serendipity is usually defined as a discovery under an accidental case , and it often results the invention of a new technology .

* The error is in the phrase "under an accidental case", which is not a common way to describe a discovery. A clearer way to describe it would be "making an accidental discovery". Additionally, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is not a definition, whereas "a phenomenon of" is frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined.

Erroneous sentence: On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .

* The error is in the phrase "on the other side", which is not a common idiom in English. The correct idiom is "on the other hand". Additionally, the subject-verb agreement error is corrected by changing "want" to "wants".

Erroneous sentence: In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .

cleaned: 
Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.

Erroneous sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .

1. The error is in the phrase "the manufacture company". The correct phrase should be "the manufacturing company" because "manufacture" is a verb, and it should be used in the present participle form "manufacturing" to describe a company that is engaged in the activity of manufacturing.

Erroneous sentence: The children rely the parent to live .

1. The error is in the phrase "rely the parent". The correct phrase should be "rely on the parents" because the verb "rely" requires the preposition "on" or "upon" to indicate the person or thing on which one relies.

Erroneous sentence: These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .

1. The error is in the phrase "people 's life". The correct phrase should be "people's lives" because "people" is a plural noun and "life" should be pluralized to agree with it.
