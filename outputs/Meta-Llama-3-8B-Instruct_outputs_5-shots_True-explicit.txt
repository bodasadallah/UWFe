Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .

1. Error:  , Correction: a
Explanation: The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. Error: altitudes, Correction: attitudes
Explanation: The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. Error:  , Correction: for
Explanation: The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

Erroneous sentence: Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .

1. Error: of, Correction: for
Explanation: Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the skill of writing) with regard to whom (a person).

Err
cleaned: 1. Error:  , Correction: a
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle. 




Error_sentence: On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Correct_sentence: On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: with, Correction: for
The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.

2. Error: the, Correction: 
"Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

3. Error: , Correction: in
Missing word. The correct expression is "get in contact".

4. Error: become, Correction: becomes
Incorrect conjugation. "Expressing themselves" is the third person singular, so use "becomes" to correspond with it.

5. Error: group, Correction: groups
The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so use the plural "groups".

6. Error: is, Correction: are
This connects back to "family members" at the beginning of the sentence, so you need to use the plural, "are", as in "Family members are a crucial factor...".

7. Error: a, Correction: the
The construction "the earlier A, the better B
cleaned: 1. Error: with, Correction: for
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Error_sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct_sentence: One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

Erroneous sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people .

1. Error: lost, Correction: loss
Explanations:
1. The verb "cause" is always followed by a noun, and "lost" is the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed to the noun "loss."
cleaned: 1. Error: lost, Correction: loss
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.




Error_sentence: I agree that RFID technology shall not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
Correct_sentence: I agree that RFID technology should not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
Prediction: Based on the examples provided, here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted.

1. Error: shall, Correction: should

Explanation: "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.

2. Error: for, Correction: to

Explanation: "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.

3. Error: and, Correction: or

Explanation: The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more
cleaned: 1. Error: shall, Correction: should
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 




Error_sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Correct_sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: spend, Correction: spending
In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a verb.

2. Error:  , Correction: the
When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.

Erroneous sentence: More supports must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of such junction whether should him/her to inform the relatives .
Correct sentence: More support must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing at such a junction whether one should inform the relatives .
Errors:
1. Error: supports, Correction: support
In the context of care and aid from other people, the word "support" is an uncountable noun and is not pluralized. It generally refers to actions or gestures, which are not tangible and cannot be counted. The word "supports" is a verb form or a noun referring to the structural components of a building that allow it to withstand force.

Erroneous sentence
cleaned: 1. Error: spend, Correction: spending
Label: 1. The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.




Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .

Erroneous sentence: And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
Correct sentence: And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering genes is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
Errors:
1. Error: gene, Correction: genes
Explanations:
1. The technology to alter genetic material could be applied not just to a single gene but any and all genes. For that reason, it's correct to use the plural "genes" rather than the singular "gene."

Erroneous sentence: It means that one can not know another 's real thought and personalities by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
Correct sentence: It means that one can not know another 's real thoughts and personality by reading things that he or she put on social network media .
Errors:
1. Error: thought, Correction:
cleaned: 1. Error: gene, Correction: genes
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Correct_sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason for the halt of the work was that the higher level authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: computer, Correction: computers
The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and "the computer" meaning one computer specifically.

2. Error: laptop, Correction: laptops
The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing laptops as a general concept, the plural "laptops" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "laptop" is used to refer to an individual laptop, with "a laptop" meaning any laptop and "the laptop" meaning one laptop specifically.

3. Error: tablet, Correction: tablets
The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing tablets as a general concept, the plural "tablets" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "tablet" is used to refer to an individual tablet, with "a tablet
cleaned: 1. Error: computer, Correction: computers
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.

Correct sentence: Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:

Erroneous sentence: I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .
Correct sentence: I noticed a real story in newspaper years ago .
Errors:
1. Error: on, Correction: in
Explanations:
1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".

Correct_sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .

1. The phrase "one year" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "years," so it should be the singular "year."

Erroneous sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?

1. The phrase "put in danger" is a common expression and the verb does not change. The verb "put" means to cause someone to be in a particular place or position.

Erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .

1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.

Errone
cleaned: 1. The phrase "one year" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "years," so it should be the singular "year."
Label: 1. Missing word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. This sentence is either referring to the parents of specific children, or parents and children in general, but either way, "parents" should be pluralised.

Correct sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Errors:
1. Error: with, Correction: for

Erroneous sentence: These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones .

cleaned: 1. Error:  , Correction: an
Label: 1. "In a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. The phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but the specificity of "the" makes it sound literal. Instead of referring figuratively to something very simple, it would mean something that is literally inside a nutshell.

Correct_sentence: This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: about, Correction: 

Explanation: The preposition "about" is used to introduce a topic or subject, but in this sentence, "the advantages and disadvantages of using social media" is already the topic, so the preposition "about" is unnecessary. Instead, we use the preposition "of" to show the relationship between the topic and the noun phrase that follows.

2. Error: life, Correction: lives

Explanation: The noun "life" is a singular noun, but when referring to multiple people's lives, we use the plural form "lives". This is because "lives" refers to the experiences and circumstances of multiple individuals, whereas "life" refers to a single, individual experience.
cleaned: 1. Error: about, Correction:
Label: 1. "Discuss" does not need to be followed by a preposition.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.

The subject of the sentence is "he/she", which is singular, so the verb "come" should be changed to the singular form "comes" to maintain subject-verb agreement.

2. Error: with, Correction: for
The phrase "with cash reimbursement" implies that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" is used to indicate that companies paid social media sites in exchange for user information, making the sentence clearer and more accurate.

3. Error: bonds, Correction: bond
The verb "bonds" should be changed to the singular form "bond" because the subject "people" is singular.

Explanation: Incorrect conjugation. "Expressing themselves" is the third person singular, so use "becomes" to correspond with it.

2. Error: , Correction: the
Explanation: When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.

3. Error: qualified, Correction: 
Explanation: The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.

4. Error: resource, Correction: resources
Explanation: The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

5.
cleaned: 1. Error: become, Correction: becomes
Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.

Correct sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenge for the innovators .

Errors:
1. Error: to make, Correction: from making
2. Error: for, Correction: and
3. Error: will, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct
cleaned: 1. Error: challenges, Correction: challenge

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: of, Correction: 

Explanation: The error is an unnecessary word. "Despite" is a preposition that indicates a contrast, and "of" is not necessary in this sentence.

2. Error: bonds, Correction: bond
Explaination: The error is an incorrect conjugation. "People" is a plural noun, so it requires a plural verb form, which is "bond" instead of "bonds".

3. Error: human, Correction: humans
Explanation: The error is an incorrect noun form. The sentence is talking about humans in general, so it should use the plural form "humans" instead of the singular form "human".

4. Error: lives, Correction: live
Explanation: The error is an incorrect conjugation. "Humans" is a plural noun, so it requires a plural verb form, which is "live" instead of "lives".

5. Error: aids, Correction: aid
Explanation: The error is an incorrect noun form. "Aid" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralized.

Erroneous sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about others .

1. Error: a, Correction: 

Explanation: "Knowledge" is an uncountable and abstract noun, so it cannot be made singular or plural, thus it cannot be used with the indefinite article 'a'.

Erroneous sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .

1. Error: years, Correction: year

Explanation: The phrase "one year" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "years", so it should be the singular "year".

Erroneous sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .

1. Error: of, Correction: for

Explanation: The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done.

2. Error: , Correction: the

Explanation: The definite article "the" is used
cleaned: 1. Error: a, Correction:
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."

Erroneous sentence: Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication .

1. Error:  , Correction: with

Erroneous sentence: These implants and products are also been used as surveillance tools .

2. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanation: The error is the use of the definite article

Explanation: As our planet is a countable noun but also the only one we know of, we call it "the world".

**Erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .**

1. Error: but, Correction: and
Explanation: The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.

**Erroneous sentence: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their

Correct_sentence: Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: ,, Correction: 
Explanation: The unnecessary comma is grammatically incorrect and disrupts the flow of the sentence. Commas are used to separate items in a list or to set off nonessential clauses, but in this case, it's not needed.

2. Error: relfected, Correction: reflected
Explanation: The word "reflected" is misspelled. It should be spelled correctly as "reflected".

3. Error: says, Correction: say
Explanation: The subject "people" is plural, so the verb "say" should be in the plural form "say" instead of "says".

4. Error: the, Correction: 
Explanation: The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of the concept in general.

5. Error: their, Correction: the
Explanation: The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".

Correct_sentence: Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transferred to the companies for spying and advertising .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: but, Correction: and
The error is using "but" instead of "and". "But" is used to contrast two things, whereas "and" is used to connect two things that are happening simultaneously. In this sentence, the two actions (neglecting people around and communicating with friends on Facebook) are happening at the same time, so "and" is the correct conjunction to use.

Erroneous sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .

Errors:

1. Error: in, Correction: 
The error is using the preposition "in" unnecessarily. The correct phrase is simply "bring", without the preposition "in".

The error is using the singular form "life" instead of the plural form "lives". The sentence is talking about people's daily lives in
cleaned: 1. Error: but, Correction: and
Label: 1. This is the passive voice, continuing from the phrase "is recorded." The passive voice requires a form of the verb "to be" followed by a secondary verb, which is always the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "transfer" to the past participle "transferred."




Error_sentence: Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
Correct_sentence: Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: if, Correction: whether
Explanation: The original sentence uses "if" to indicate a choice between two options, but "if" is typically used to indicate a condition or a possibility. In this case, "whether" is a better choice to indicate the two options of agreeing with or not agreeing with existing laws.

2. Error: thought, Correction: think
Explanation: The sentence is expressing the writer's current opinion, so the present tense "think" is more suitable than the past tense "thought".

3. Errors:
1. Error: , products, Correction: . Products
2. Error: system, Correction: systems
Explanation:
1. The two sentences should be separated by a period (.) instead of a comma (,).
2. The sentence is referring to multiple RFID tracking systems, so the plural form "systems" is more accurate than the singular form "system".

4. Error: their, Correction: the
Explanation: The sentence is referring to a general right that anyone has, not a specific right belonging to the parents, so the definite article "the" is more suitable than the possessive adjective "their".

5. Error: more, Correction: 
Explanation: "E
cleaned: 1. Error: if, Correction: whether
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."
2. The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.

Erroneous sentence: To put it in the nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Correct sentence: To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction: a
Explanations:
1. "In a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. The phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but the specificity of "the" makes it sound literal. Instead of referring figuratively to something very simple, it would mean something that is literally inside a nutshell.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .

Error 1: The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.

Error 2: The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.

Error 3: The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

2. Error: Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .

Error 1: The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work
cleaned: 1. Error: When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .

1. Error: study, Correction: studying
This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."

2. Error: in, Correction: 
The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.

3. Error: friend, Correction: friends
When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.

Erroneous sentence: As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .

cleaned: 1. Error: study, Correction: studying
Label: 1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.

Correct_sentence: That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: with, Correction: for
The phrase "with cash reimbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.

2. Error: elements, Correction: element
The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.

3. Error: but, Correction: and
The sentence is describing two actions that happen simultaneously, so "and" is used to connect them. "But" would imply a contrast between the two actions, which is not the intended meaning.

4. Error: a, Correction: the
The construction "the earlier A, the better B" is talking about specifics, with a greater focus on B. As such, B requires an article, and as you are talking about something specific, you should use the definite article, "the".

5. Error: dilemma, Correction: dilemmas
The sentence is referring to multiple unspecified family-related ethical issues, so the plural form "dilemmas" is used.

6. Error: elements

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: of, Correction: 

Unnecessary word. If you were using "in spite" it would be okay to write "in spite of the distance", but "of" is not necessary when using "despite".

2. Error: comes, Correction: come
Explanations:
Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "come" to go with "advantages".

3. Error: application, Correction: applications
Explanations:
The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.

4. Error: in, Correction: on
Explanations:
We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".

5. Error: qualified, Correction: 
Explanations:
The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources
cleaned: 1. Error: of, Correction:
Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.

Errors:
1. Error: shall, Correction: should
2. Error: for, Correction: to
3. Error: and, Correction: or
Explanations:
1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.

Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: are, Correction: were
3. Error: connect, Correction: connected
4. Error: live, Correction: lived
Explanations:
1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: causing, Correction: cause
This sentence is not talking about something that is currently happening, but something that could happen, so you need to change the present continuous "causing" to the present "cause".

2. Error: a, Correction: 
"Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."

The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.

cleaned: 1. Error: causing, Correction: cause
Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: computer, Correction: computers
The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and "the computer" meaning one computer specifically.

2. Error: laptop, Correction: laptops
The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural.

1. Error: the, Correction: a
The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many.

2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."

Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Error_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance .
Correct_sentence: Through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .
Prediction: I'll be happy to help you with that. Here's the explanation for each error:

Erroneous sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .

1. Error: years, Correction: year
Explanations: The phrase "one year" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "years," so it should be the singular "year."

Erroneous sentence: With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status .

1. Error: status, Correction: statuses
Explanations: The list is talking about things in general, and so "status" should be pluralised to match "conversations", "blogs" and "photos".

Erroneous sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .

1. Error: with, Correction: for
Explanations: The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange,
cleaned: 1. Error: years, Correction: year
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. If you were using "in spite" it would be okay to write "in spite of the distance", but "of" is not necessary when using "despite".

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

Erroneous sentence: As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .

1. Error: the, Correction: a
Explanations: The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "As the result" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a result," which implies that the outcome is one of several.

Erroneous sentence: Looking at this third step we realize why the second stage of an engineering design process of gathering information is important.Once all the information is put together into the different possible solutions , the engineer is put to decide which method out of the lot is suited best for the purpose and if agrees with existing international laws .

1. Error: if, Correction: whether

Errors:

Label: 1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."




Error_sentence: For example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Correct_sentence: For example , we tend send birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " Today is someone 's birthday " .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanation: The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.

2. Error: relationship, Correction: relationships
Explanation: When referencing relationships as a general concept, the plural "relationships" should be used because it references multiple relationships between many different people. The singular "relationship" is used to refer to individual relationships, with "a relationship" meaning any relationship and "the relationship" meaning one relationship specifically.

3. Error:  , Correction: ,
Explanation: A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.

Explanation: The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states
cleaned: 1. Error: the, Correction:
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "birthday wishes." Either "birthday wishes" or "a birthday wish" would be acceptable.

Erroneous sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted.

Correct sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted.

1. Error: shall, Correction: should
Explanation: "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.

2. Error: for, Correction: to
Explanation: "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.

3. Error: and, Correction: or
Explanation: The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion
cleaned: 1. Error: shall, Correction: should
Label: 1. The singular noun "thought" refers to a single idea or opinion. For example, "I think I'd like eggs for breakfast" or "She thinks it would be fun to try beekeeping" are two thoughts. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "thoughts" should be pluralized.
2. The singular noun "personality" means a collection of traits, behaviors, or emotional qualities that make up an individual's character. The plural noun "personalities" refers to the personalities of multiple people.

Erroneous sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .

1. Error: disadvantage, Correction: disadvantages
Explanation: The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results.

2. Error: the, Correction: 
Explanation: The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose".

3. Error: of, Correction: in
Explanation: The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.

Erroneous sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .

Error_sentence: On one side , it is obvioualy that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Correct_sentence: On one side , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences:

1. Error: Engineering, Correction: The engineering

The definite article "the" is used to imply a comparison. The phrase "the engineering process" implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks "the engineering process" as being distinct from those other processes.

2. Error: fused, Correction: (no correction needed)

The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together, but its meaning and connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.

3. Error: on, Correction: one

The author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. Changing "on" to "one" fixes the problem.

4. Error: desired deeds, Correction: (no correction needed)

The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and should be changed to something like "what others desire."

Erroneous sentence: When electronic devices are not grounded properly , there is a probability that the

Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "obvious." Also, it looks like the author intended to use the word "obviously," which is an adverb. Adverbs are used to modify verbs, but in this sentence, the word follows "it is" and therefore should be a noun.

Explanation: This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "believe."

Erroneous sentence: With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life .

1. Error: others, Correction: other
Explanation: "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Error: aspect, Correction: role
Explanation: Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is
cleaned: 1. Error: belive, Correction: believe

Erroneous sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .
Correct sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child .
Errors:
1. Error: their, Correction: the
Explanations:
1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".

Erroneous sentence: On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Correct sentence: On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
Errors:
1. Error: side, Correction: hand
2. Error: want, Correction: wants

Label: 1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.

Erroneous sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other 's permission , this should not be placed or implanted to anyone .

1. Error: other 's, Correction: 
As "permission" is something granted by another person, this is already taken for granted without needing to explicitly say "other's".

You should explicitly state "technology" for clarity.

An implant goes inside the body, so you need to use "in" accordingly.

Erroneous sentence: It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other .

1. Error: with, Correction: to
When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk

Label: 1. The noun "policy" requires either an article or pluralization. The definite article "the" refers to a specific policy, especially one that was mentioned earlier in the text. Because no such policy was mentioned, it should be changed to the indefinite article "a," which refers to one single unspecified policy out of multiple potential policies, or alternately to the plural "policies," which means multiple unspecified policies.

Explanations:
1. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and "the computer" meaning one computer specifically.

It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."

**Erroneous sentence: These green house gases are the main cause to worldwide global warming which give rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .**

1. Error: to, Correction: of

Explanation: This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event.

Correct_sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences:

Erroneous sentence: The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .

1. Error: a, Correction: the
Explanations: The construction "the earlier A, the better B" is talking about specifics, with a greater focus on B. As such, B requires an article, and as you are talking about something specific, you should use the definite article, "the".

Erroneous sentence: In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .

1. Error: the, Correction: 
Explanations: The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. Error: are, Correction: were
Explanations: This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "

Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.




Error_sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct_sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: Researches, Correction: Research
Explanations: "Research" is a singular noun, referring to a single study or investigation. It should be used in the singular form "Research", not the plural form "Researches".

2. Error: show, Correction: shows
Explanations: The subject of the sentence is "Research", which is a singular noun. Therefore, the verb "shows" should be used in the singular form, not the plural form "show".
cleaned: 1. Error: Researches, Correction: Research
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.




Error_sentence: Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Correct_sentence: Writing is an essential skill for person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: qualified, Correction: 
The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.

2. Error: resource, Correction: resources
The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

Erroneous sentence: There are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages , however in real life , he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly .
Correct sentence: There are many people on social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages , however in real life , he or she may not have jobs or live poorly .

Erroneous sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people .
Correct sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
Errors:
1. Error: lost, Correction: loss
Explanations:
1. The verb "cause" is always followed by a noun, and "lost" is the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed to the noun "loss."
cleaned: 1. Error: lost, Correction: loss
Label: 1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."

Correct sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: contacts, Correction: contact
Explanations:
1. "Contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. When used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.

2. Erroneous sentence: Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Correct sentence: Writing is an essential skill for person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Errors:
1. Error: of, Correction: for

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Error:  , Correction: the
Explanation: The definite article "the" is used to refer to a specific thing, in this case, the corporate world. It differentiates it from other worlds, such as the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc.

2. Error: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Error: network, Correction: networks
Explanation: When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one.

3. Error: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .
Error: spend, Correction: spending
Explanation: The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the
cleaned: 1. Error: In corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work .

Correct sentence: As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .
Error: the, Correction: 
Explanation: The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.

Error: contacts, Correction: contact
Explanation: The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable.
cleaned: 1. Erroneous sentence: Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .

1. Error: length, Correction: lengths
Explanation: This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.

2. Error: shorter, Correction: short
Explanation: Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".

Erroneous sentence: Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .

1. Error: genetic, Correction: 
Explanation: The adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted.


cleaned: 1. Error: length, Correction: lengths
Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .

Error 1: their, Correction: the

Explanation: The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".

Erroneous sentence: For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than five percent of the population in the China .

Error 1: lesser, Correction: less
Error 2: the, Correction:  

Explanation 1: The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less".
Explanation 2: China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.

Erroneous sentence: However , these procedures might become another challenges

1. Erroneous sentence: Family members , as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder .

Error 1: group, Correction: groups
Explanation: The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so use the plural "groups" to maintain consistency and accuracy.

Error 2: is, Correction: are
Explanation: This connects back to "family members" at the beginning of the sentence, so you need to use the plural, "are", as in "Family members are a crucial factor...".

2. Erroneous sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement .

Error 1: the, Correction: 
Explanation: The concept of "technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific advancement instead of the progress of technology in general.

3. Erroneous sentence: The children rely the parent to live .

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .

1. Error: with, Correction: for
Explanation: The phrase "with cash reimbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.

Erroneous sentence: Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .

1. Error: the, Correction: (no correction needed)
Explanation: The sentence is discussing surveillance technology in general and therefore does not need an article.

2. Error: invading, Correction: safeguarding
Explanation: The verb "invading" implies a harmful or unauthorized action, whereas "safeguarding" implies protecting or preserving something. The correct verb choice depends on the intended meaning of the sentence.

3. Error: the, Correction: (no correction needed)
Explanation: The sentence is discussing human privacy in general, so it does not require an article.

Erroneous sentence: Facebook is like a combination of message and
cleaned: 1. Error: with, Correction: for
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".

Correct sentence: I do not agree with this statement that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Errors:
1. Error: on, Correction: with
2. Error: argument, Correction: statement
Explanations:
1. If you "agree on" something it usually means you reach a compromise with someone. When talking about an opinion and saying whether you agree or disagree, "agree" is usually followed by the preposition "with".
2. Incorrect word choice. This is an opinion/assertion that is being stated, so use "statement".

Erroneous sentence: Overall , I belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .

Erroneous sentence: It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes .
Correct sentence: It is also important to use better material that can support buildings during any natural disasters like earthquakes .
Errors:
1. Error: create, Correction: use
Explanation: The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.

2. Error: a, Correction:  
Explanation: The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" refers to one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.

3. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanation: "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so
cleaned: 1. Error: create, Correction: use
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.

1. Error: thousand, Correction: thousands
Explanation: The word "thousand" is being used to describe a large, unspecified amount, so it should be pluralized as "thousands".

Explanation: The word "supports" is an uncountable noun and should not be pluralized.

This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.

2. Error: shorter, Correction: short
Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".

1. Error: , Correction: a
The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.

Correct sentence: Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden in her family .

Error 1: Error: the, Correction: a
Explanation: The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."

Erroneous sentence: As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .

Correct sentence: As a result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .

Explanation: The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of to innovators in general.

2. Error: immediate, Correction: immediately

Explanation: Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately".

5. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "did" implies that the phone is no longer involved in people's work, so it should be the present tense "do" instead.

Correct_sentence: Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not reflected as something positive to the users .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: immediate, Correction: immediately
Explanation: "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb "disseminate", so you need to use the adverb form "immediately".

2. Error: is, Correction: was
Explanation: Talking about something that happened in the past, so use the past tense "was".

3. Error: , Correction: on
Explanation: The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.

4. Error: parent, Correction: parents
Explanation: The subject is "children", which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.

5. Error: , Correction: the
Explanation: The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to
cleaned: 1. Error: immediate, Correction: immediately
Label: 1. Unnecessary comma. The position of the comma is grammatically incorrect.
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "reflected".




Error_sentence: I do not agree on this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Correct_sentence: I do not agree with this statement that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: device, Correction: devices
The error is that the singular noun "device" is used to refer to multiple electronic devices. The correct word is the plural form "devices" to indicate that the auto-correction software is effective for multiple devices.

2. Error: the, Correction: 
The error is that the uncountable noun "social media" should not have an article. Social media is a general concept, not a specific instance of social media, so it does not require an article.

3. Error: , Correction: in
The error is that the phrase "get contact" is incomplete and does not make sense. The correct phrase is "get in contact" to indicate establishing communication with someone.

4. Error: Engineering, Correction: The engineering
The error is that the definite article "the" is used to refer to the engineering design process. The correct phrase is "The engineering design process" to indicate a specific process.

5. Error: fused, Correction: 
The error is that the verb "fuse" is used incorrectly. The verb "fuse" means to combine or join together, which does not make sense in the context of the engineering design process.

6.
cleaned: 1. Error: device, Correction: devices
Label: 1. If you "agree on" something it usually means you reach a compromise with someone. When talking about an opinion and saying whether you agree or disagree, "agree" is usually followed by the preposition "with".
2. Incorrect word choice. This is an opinion/assertion that is being stated, so use "statement".




Error_sentence: However , critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
Correct_sentence: However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: with, Correction: 
Explanation: The phrase "with the existence of social media sites" is a subordinate clause, and the verb "has" agrees with the subject "existence", which is singular. Therefore, the verb "has" should be used instead of "have".

2. Error: have, Correction: has
Explanation: The phrase "the existence of social media sites" is a singular noun phrase, and the verb "has" agrees with the subject "existence", which is singular. Therefore, the verb "has" should be used instead of "have".

Note: The other errors you provided earlier have been corrected earlier.
cleaned: 1. Error: with, Correction:
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".




Error_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .
Correct_sentence: With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world .

Correct sentence: In past decades , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: are, Correction: were
3. Error: connect, Correction: connected
4. Error: live, Correction: lived
Explanations:
1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events

2. Error: are, Correction: were
3. Error: connect, Correction: connected
4. Error: live, Correction: lived
Label: 1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .

1. Error: in, Correction: 

Explanation: The phrase "keep confidential" is common and is used without variation in wording. The phrase "in confidence" is not a common phrase and is likely a mistake.

Erroneous sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .

1. Error: spend, Correction: spending

Explanation: In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a verb.

2. Error:  , Correction: the

Explanation: When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: If China can come up with effective policy to change its education system and stimulate innovation , China 's pace to flourish may become even faster .

1. Error: , Correction: an
Explanation: The noun "policy" requires either an article or pluralization. The definite article "the" refers to a specific policy, especially one that was mentioned earlier in the text. Because no such policy was mentioned, it should be changed to the indefinite article "a," which refers to one single unspecified policy out of multiple potential policies, or alternately to the plural "policies," which means multiple unspecified policies.

Erroneous sentence: However , critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .

1. Error: with, Correction: 
Explanation: Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the

Label: 1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need. There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.

2. Error: invading, Correction: safeguarding
3. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. This sentence is talking about surveillance technology in general and therefore does not need an article.
2. The verb "invading" implies a negative action, whereas "safeguarding" implies a positive action, which changes the tone of the sentence.
3. The sentence is discussing human privacy in general, so it does not require an article.

2. Error
cleaned: 1. Error: the, Correction:
2. Error: invading, Correction: safeguarding
3. Error: the, Correction:
Label: 1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.

Erroneous sentence: It is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connect people globally .

Explanation: When used as a verb, "connect" requires the correct verb form "connects" instead of "connect".

Erroneous sentence: This essay will discuss about both the benefits and down sides of using social media in the contemporary society .

Explanation: The verb "discuss" does not take the preposition "about". Instead, the object of discussion comes directly after the verb.

Explanation: The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.

Erroneous sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .

Correct_sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance of carrying certain disease .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: to, Correction: of
Explanation: The phrase "high chance to carry" is incorrect. The correct phrase is "high chance of carrying", as "of" is the correct preposition to use with "chance" when describing the likelihood of something happening.

Note: There is no error 2, as the correction list only mentions one error.

The erroneous sentence is: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease .

Correct sentence: Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance of carrying certain disease .

Please let me know if you would like me to clarify anything!
cleaned: 1. Error: to, Correction: of
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.




Error_sentence: Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts .
Correct_sentence: Thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotional thoughts .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: come, Correction: comes
The subject is "he/she", which is singular, so the verb should be singular for subject-verb agreement. The verb "come" should be replaced with the singular form "comes" to maintain grammatical accuracy.

2. Error: altitudes, Correction: attitudes
The word "altitude" refers to height, whereas "attitude" refers to a way of thinking or feeling. The correct word in this context is "attitudes", which means a way of thinking or feeling that is easily changed.

3. Error: , Correction: a
The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. In this case, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article "a".

4. Error: claimed, Correction: claim
The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today". Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.

5. Error: medias, Correction: media
"Media" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralized
cleaned: 1. Error: come, Correction: comes
Label: 1. This is a typo. The correct spelling is "emotional."

Errors:

2. Error: in particularly for, Correction: particularly
3. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.
2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own.
3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.

cleaned: 1. Error: be, Correction:
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is used when something exists in an unspecified manner or amount, or to express one out of multiple options.

Error_sentence: This essay will discuss about both the benefits and down sides of using social media in the contemporary society .
Correct_sentence: This essay will discuss both the benefits and down sides of using social media in contemporary society .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "the" before "social media" -> Correction: (no article needed)
Explanation: "Social media" is an uncountable noun, which means it's a mass noun or a non-countable noun. Uncountable nouns don't need articles, so we remove the article "the" before "social media".

2. Error: missing word "in" -> Correction: "in"
Explanation: The correct expression is "get in contact", not just "get contact". The preposition "in" is necessary to indicate the manner or way of getting in touch with someone.

3. Error: "the" before "society" -> Correction: (no article needed)
Explanation: "Society" is also an uncountable noun, so it doesn't need an article. We remove the article "the" before "society".

4. Error: "on" instead of "in" -> Correction: "in"
Explanation: When talking about reading something, like a newspaper or book, we use the preposition "in" instead of "on". This is because we're reading the content inside the publication, not just looking at the surface or cover.

5. Error: missing article
cleaned: 1. Error: "the" before "social media" -> Correction: (no article needed)
Label: 1. The verb "discuss" does not take the preposition "about." While "about" is used with similar verbs like "tell" or "talk," in the case of "discuss," the object simply comes directly after, with no need for a preposition.
2. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.




Error_sentence: Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .
Correct_sentence: Although surveillance technology is an issue in safeguarding human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: Therefore , Correction: a

This error is due to the lack of an article ("a" or "the") before the noun "need". In this context, "a need" is a singular noun phrase, and therefore requires the indefinite article "a".

2. Error: of, Correction: for

This error is due to the incorrect use of the preposition "of" instead of "for". "For" is used to indicate the purpose or reason for something, whereas "of" is used to indicate possession or origin. In this sentence, "for" is the correct preposition to use because it indicates the purpose of writing (to express one's own feelings and opinions).

3. Error: , Correction: the

This error is due to the lack of the definite article "the" before the noun "work". In this sentence, "the work" refers to a specific instance of work, and therefore requires the definite article "the".

4. Error: , Correction: the

This error is due to the lack of the definite article "the" before the noun "engineering project". In this sentence, "the engineering project" refers to a specific instance of an engineering
cleaned: 1. Error: Therefore , Correction: a
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about surveillance technology in general and therefore does not need an article.
2. None
3. The sentence is discussing human privacy in general, so it does not require an article.




Error_sentence: Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Correct_sentence: Some genes will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: moral, Correction: morals
An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."

2. Error: with, Correction: 
Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.

3. Error: have, Correction: has
Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".

4. Error: comes, Correction: come
Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "come" to go with "advantages".

5. Error: application, Correction: applications
The sentence is discussing smartphone applications
cleaned: 1. Error: moral, Correction: morals
Label: 1. The adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted.
2. The word "some" means an unspecified amount or a large amount. It is usually used with plural nouns. Also, it is unlikely that there is only one gene that can only be inherited by a specific gender, so logically it is more likely to be the plural.

Correct sentence: The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic devices until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Errors:
1. Error: device, Correction: devices
Explanations:
1. Auto-correct is a feature that is common to many different electronic devices, so the plural "devices" should be used. The singular "device" is used to refer to individual devices, with "a device" meaning any device and "the device" meaning one specific device.

Erroneous sentence: On one side , it is obvioualy that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Correct sentence: On one side , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Errors:
1. Error: obvioualy, Correction: obvious

cleaned: 1. Error: device, Correction: devices
Label: 1. The subject here is the plural "people," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "say."

Explanations: Talking about something that happened in the past, so use the past tense "was".

Erroneous sentence: In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .

1. Error: the, Correction: (no correction needed)
Explanations: The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. Error: are, Correction: were
Explanations: This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "are" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. Error: connect, Correction:
cleaned: 1. Error: is, Correction: was
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about others .

1. Error: a, Correction: 

Explanation: "Knowledge" is an uncountable and abstract noun, so it cannot be made singular or plural, thus it cannot be used with the indefinite article 'a'.

Erroneous sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .

1. Error: in, Correction: 

Explanation: Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.

2. Error: life, Correction: lives

Explanation: This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.

3. Error: effect, Correction: effects

Explanation: This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.

Erroneous sentence: Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can
cleaned: 1. Error: a, Correction:
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Interpersonal skills" is the third person plural, so use "are" to correspond with it.




Error_sentence: There are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages , however in real life , he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly .
Correct_sentence: There are many people on social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages , however in real life , he or she may not have jobs or live poorly .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: if, Correction: whether

I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) whether that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: whether it agrees with existing laws or whether it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.

2. Error: time, Correction: times

When generally referring to a period of hardship, time is pluralised, so the correct expression is "the hard times".

3. Error: says, Correction: say

The subject here is the plural "people," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "say".

4. Error: the, Correction: None

The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.

5. Error: thought, Correction: thoughts

The singular noun "
cleaned: 1. Error: if, Correction: whether
Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.




Error_sentence: The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him .
Correct_sentence: The medical treatment technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .

1. Error: , Correction: the
Explanation: Missing article. As you are talking specifically about the next generation, use the definite article, "the".

Erroneous sentence: With a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status .

1. Error: status, Correction: statuses
Explanation: The list is talking about things in general, and so "status" should be pluralised to match "conversations", "blogs", and "photos".

Erroneous sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem .

1. Error: become, Correction: becomes
Explanation: Incorrect conjugation. "Expressing themselves" is the third person singular, so use "becomes" to correspond with it.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

Erroneous sentence: The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him .

1. Error: is, Correction: was
Explanations: Talking about something that happened in the past, so use the past tense "was".

Erroneous sentence: Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .

1. Error: dignosis, Correction: diagnosis
Explanations: Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "diagnosis".
2. Error: Seconly, Correction: Secondly
Explanations: Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "Secondly".

Erroneous sentence: As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .

1. Error: passed, Correction: passes
Explanations: The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense
cleaned: 1. Error: is, Correction: was
Label: 1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific societies, instead of modern society in general.




Error_sentence: Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .
Correct_sentence: Personally I am studying oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friends .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: the
Correction: (no correction needed)

The concept of "technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific advancement instead of the progress of technology in general.

2. Error: become
Correction: becomes

Incorrect conjugation. "Expressing themselves" is the third person singular, so use "becomes" to correspond with it.

3. Error: 
Correction: the

The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.

4. Error: challenges
Correction: challenge

The pronoun "another" means "one more," so it is singular and cannot be used with the plural "challenges." The singular "challenge" should be used instead.

5. Error: are
Correction: have

The perfect present tense should be used to show that the action of using implants and products is currently still happening. To create the perfect present, we use "have"
cleaned: 1. Error: the
Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.




Error_sentence: Human has their own rights and privacy .
Correct_sentence: Humans have their own rights and privacy .
Prediction: I'll provide explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences.

**Erroneous sentence: Also, according to a research, it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people's lives.**

1. Error: "a" - Correction: 
Explanation: "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a". To refer to research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research".

2. Error: "the" - Correction: 
Explanation: The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.

3. Error: "the" - Correction: 
Explanation: Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general.

**Erroneous sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile, he or she concurently has a knowledge about others.**

1. Error: "a" - Correction: 
Explanation: "Knowledge" is an uncountable and abstract noun, so it cannot be
cleaned: 1. Error: "a" - Correction:
Label: 1. The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".




Error_sentence: He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet .
Correct_sentence: He can even talk to his daughter face-to-face using video call via the internet .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: challenges, Correction: challenge
The pronoun "another" means "one more," so it is singular and cannot be used with the plural "challenges." The singular "challenge" should be used instead.

2. Error: device, Correction: devices
Auto-correct is a feature that is common to many different electronic devices, so the plural "devices" should be used. The singular "device" is used to refer to individual devices, with "a device" meaning any device and "the device" meaning one specific device.

3. Error: moral, Correction: morals
An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."

4. Error: the, Correction: (no article needed)
The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."

5. Error: thousand, Correction: thousands
This sentence is not using "th
cleaned: 1. Error: challenges, Correction: challenge
Label: 1. Missing article. "Internet" is the name of a specific network, so use the definite article, "the".
2. The sentence starts with "He", referring to man, but the third person possessive you have used is the female version. Change to "his" to match with "He" and make it clear that you are talking about a man.

Correct_sentence: There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Correct sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: the
Explanations:
1. Missing article. As our planet is a countable noun but also the only one we know of, we call it "the world".

Erroneous sentence: While we do know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
Correct sentence: While we do know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: against
Explanations:
1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action,
cleaned: 1. Error:  , Correction: the
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Seek out" does not require the preposition "for" to indicate what is being sought out.




Error_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Correct_sentence: Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: "a" -> Correction: "research"
Explanation: "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it should not have an article "a" before it.

2. Error: "the" -> Correction: ""
Explanation: The sentence is talking about users in general, so there is no need to use the definite article "the" before the noun "users".

3. Error: "the" -> Correction: ""
Explanation: "Facebook" is a proper noun, so it should not have an article "the" before it.

4. Error: "contacts" -> Correction: "contact"
Explanation: "Contact" is an uncountable noun, so it should not have an "s" at the end. It's also not necessary to use the definite article "the" before it.

5. Error: "internet" -> Correction: "the internet"
Explanation: When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the". This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.

6. Error: "says" -> Correction: "say"
Explanation: The
cleaned: 1. Error: "a" -> Correction: "research"
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.

2. Error: the, Correction: 
Explanation: The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader.

3. Error: image, Correction: images
Explanation: When referencing images
cleaned: 1. Error: a, Correction:
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "come" to go with "advantages".
2. The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.
3. We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .

1. Error: in, Correction: 
Explanation: Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.

2. Error: life, Correction: lives
Explanation: This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.

3. Error: effect, Correction: effects
Explanation: This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.

Erroneous sentence: This is the common law in the society .

1. Error: the, Correction: 
Explanation: As "society" is something general and uncountable, it does not need an article, so remove "the".

Erroneous sentence: Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies for spying and advertising .

1. Error: transfer, Correction: transferred
Explanation: This is the
cleaned: 1. Error: in, Correction:
Label: 1. From the sentence we can surmise that the people would have more than one check, so the plural "checks" should be used.

Erroneous sentence: Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue .
Correct sentence: Here I want to share Forest 's view on this issue .
Errors:
1. Error: Forest'view, Correction: Forest 's view
Explanations:
1. An "s" and a space are missing. There should be an "s" after the apostrophe and "view" should be a separate word.

Erroneous sentence: Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Correct sentence: Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: a
Explanations:
1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need. There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.

Erroneous sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have a unhealthy baby and may
cleaned: 1. Error: Forest'view, Correction: Forest 's view
Label: 1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.




Error_sentence: Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .
Correct_sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: add-on, Correction: add-ons
The sentence is discussing add-ons in general, so "add-on" should be pluralised.
cleaned: 1. Error: add-on, Correction: add-ons
Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."




Error_sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience .
Correct sentence: Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experiences .
Errors:
1. Error: shwing, Correction: showing
Explanation: This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."

2. Error: experience, Correction: experiences
Explanation: The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.

Erroneous sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .
Correct sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one year ago,when I just arrived singapore .
Errors:
1. Error: years, Correction: year
Explanation: The phrase "one year" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "years," so it should be the singular "year."

Erroneous sentence: I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and
cleaned: 1. Error: shwing, Correction: showing
Label: 1. The phrase "put in danger" is a common expression and the verb does not change. The verb "put" means to cause someone to be in a particular place or position.

Explanation: The statement is confusing two phrases: "keep confidential" and "in confidence." The phrase "keep confidential" is common and is used without variation in wording.
cleaned: 1. Error: in, Correction:
Label: 1. The verb "cause" is always followed by a noun, and "lost" is the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed to the noun "loss."

Correct sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to .

Errors:
1. Error: Engineering, Correction: The engineering
Explanation: The definite article "the" can imply a comparison. The phrase "the engineering process" implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks "the engineering process" as being distinct from those other processes.

2. Error: fused, Correction: 
Explanation: The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.

3. Error: on, Correction: 
Explanation: As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning
cleaned: 1. Error: Engineering, Correction: The engineering
Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.

Correct_sentence: Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: the, Correction: (Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .)
This sentence is talking about surveillance technology in general and therefore does not need an article.

2. Error: invading, Correction: safeguarding (Although surveillance technology is an issue in safeguarding human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .)
None, as the correction is to replace the word "invading" with a more accurate and relevant word "safeguarding".

3. Error: the, Correction: (Although surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .)
The sentence is discussing human privacy in general, so it does not require an article.

Erroneous sentence: In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
Correct sentence: In addition , privacy issues have become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share in the first place .
Errors:
1. Error: issue
cleaned: 1. Error: the, Correction: (Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy , it has also brought us lots of benefits and security .)
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".




Error_sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery .
Correct_sentence: This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation , particularly small children who are studying in nursery .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: elements, Correction: element
The subject of the statement is "that", which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well. In this case, "element" is a singular noun that refers to a single thing, whereas "elements" is a plural noun that refers to multiple things.

2. Error: belive, Correction: believe
This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "believe".

3. Error: the, Correction: (none)
"Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article. Uncountable nouns are things that cannot be counted, such as water, air, or music. They do not have a plural form and do not need an article.

4. Error: obvioualy, Correction: obvious
This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "obvious". Additionally, "obviously" is an adverb that is used to modify verbs, but in this sentence, the word follows "it is" and therefore should be a noun.

5. Error: the, Correction: (none)
The concept of "technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood
cleaned: 1. Error: elements, Correction: element
Label: 1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.
2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own.
3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.

Label: 1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.

Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: the

Erroneous sentence: There are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages , however in real life , he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly .

1. Error: in, Correction: on
Explanation: Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. Error: the, Correction: 
Explanation: The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.

Erroneous sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .
Correct sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
Errors:
1. Error: immediate, Correction: immediately
Explanations:
1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".

Erroneous sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .

Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

Erroneous sentence: Based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites .

1. Error: of, Correction: 
Explanation: The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." The phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is unclear. It should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills" to make the meaning clear.

2. Error: in, Correction: on
Explanation: When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here.

Erroneous sentence: There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .

1. Error: for, Correction: 
Explanation: Unnecessary word. "Seek out" does not require the preposition "for" to indicate what is being sought out.

Erroneous sentence: The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people
cleaned: 1. Error: of, Correction:
Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner.

Correct sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately becomes really a big problem .

Correct_sentence: With the willing of people to become the best among others , social network sites now become a place to show off .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: the, Correction: 

Explanation: This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general and therefore should not have an article. The phrase "interpersonal skills" is a general concept and does not refer to a specific set of skills, so the definite article "the" is unnecessary.

2. Error: are, Correction: have

Explanation: The perfect present tense should be used to show that the action of using implants and products is currently still happening. To create the perfect present, we use "have" and the past participle "used". The verb "are" is in the present tense, which does not convey the intended meaning.

3. Error: the, Correction: 

Explanation: The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society, instead of the concept in general.

4. Error: Human, Correction: Humans

Correct_sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: with, Correction: to

The correction is not entirely clear-cut. While "talk to" is a more common phrase in this context, "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk with" can have a nuance of consulting with someone or a conversation between peers or equals.

2. Error: to, Correction: 

The verb "face" is an intransitive verb that means to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.

Erroneous sentence: One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .

Correct sentence: One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .

1. Error: disadvantage, Correction: disadvantages

The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results.

2. Error: the, Correction: 

The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

Erroneous sentence: I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .

1. Error: years, Correction: year
Explanation: The phrase "one year" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "years," so it should be the singular "year."

Erroneous sentence: Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .

1. Error: be, Correction: (omission)
Explanation: The first "be" in the sentence can be used for both "shy" and "afraid", you do not need to repeat it for "afraid".

Erroneous sentence: Serendipity is usually defined as a discovery under an accidental case , and it often results the invention of a new technology .

1. Error: a discovery under an accidental case, Correction: the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery
Explanation: The structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an unintentional discovery".

2. Error:  , Correction: in
Explanation: The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of
cleaned: 1. Error: years, Correction: year
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".
2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.

Correct sentence: As time passes , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined .
Errors:
1. Error: passed, Correction: passes
Explanations:
1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.

Correct sentence: Therefore , considering people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the peace of the family , I support that a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person
cleaned: 1. Error: passed, Correction: passes
Label: 1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
2. The subject is "children," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.

Erroneous sentence: And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .

1. Error: gene, Correction: genes
Explanation: The technology to alter genetic material could be applied not just to a single gene but any and all genes. For that reason, it's correct to use the plural "genes" rather than the singular "gene."

Erroneous sentence: This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa .

1. Error: has, Correction: have
Explanation: The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. Error: under, Correction: at
Explanation: While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used
cleaned: 1. Error: gene, Correction: genes
Label: 1. This sentence is not talking about something that is currently happening, but something that could happen, so you need to change the present continuous "causing" to the present "cause".

Erroneous sentence: Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend .

Correct sentence: Personally I am studying oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friends .

1. Error: study, Correction: studying
Explanations:
1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."

2. Error: in, Correction: 
Explanations:
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.

3. Error: friend, Correction
cleaned: 1. Error: for, Correction:

Correct_sentence: Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden in her family .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: if, Correction: whether

The error is in the use of "if" which implies a specific condition whereas in this context, the engineer needs to consider two options: whether the method is suitable and whether it agrees with existing laws. The correct word to use is "whether" which indicates a choice between two options.

2. Error: Engineering, Correction: The engineering

The error is in the use of the definite article "the" which implies a comparison, making it clear that the engineering design process is distinct from other processes.

3. Error: fused, Correction: by

The error is in the use of the verb "fuse" which means to combine or join together. Its meaning and connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.

4. Error: on, Correction: one

The error is in the use of the word "on" which cannot be used alone to mean "the current process". The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one", meaning "the current process".

5. Error: desired deeds, Correction: what others desire

The error is in the use of the phrase "desired deeds" which is unclear
cleaned: 1. Error: if, Correction: whether
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."

Erroneous sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Correct sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Error: with, Correction: for
Explanation: The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.

Erroneous sentence: This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort
cleaned: 1. Error: other 's, Correction:
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".

Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.

Correct sentence: This means both of his parents have gene A and they are both at high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests
cleaned: 1. Error: passed, Correction: passes
Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentences:

Erroneous sentence: The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us .

1. Error: The, Correction: However , the
Explanation: This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.

2. Error: using, Correction: use
Explanation: This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".

3. Error: over, Correction: on
Explanation: Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.

4. Error: on, Correction: over
Explanation: If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.

Erroneous sentence: Seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .

1. Error: dignosis, Correction:
cleaned: 1. Error: The, Correction: However , the

Correct_sentence: Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: a, Correction: 
The error is the use of the indefinite article "a" before the uncountable noun "research". The correction is to remove the article, as "research" is a singular, uncountable noun that does not require an article.

2. Error: the, Correction: 
The error is the use of the definite article "the" before the general noun "users". The correction is to remove the article, as "users" is a general noun that does not require an article.

3. Error: the, Correction: 
The error is the use of the definite article "the" before the proper noun "Facebook". The correction is to remove the article, as "Facebook" is a proper noun that does not require an article.

1. Error: medias, Correction: media
The error is the pluralization of the uncountable noun "media". The correction is to use the singular form "media", as "media" is an uncountable noun that does not take a plural form.

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: on, Correction: with
Explanation: If you "agree on" something it usually means you reach a compromise with someone. When talking about an opinion and saying whether you agree or disagree, "agree" is usually followed by the preposition "with".

2. Error: argument, Correction: statement
Explanation: Incorrect word choice. This is an opinion/assertion that is being stated, so use "statement".

3. Error: the, Correction: a
Explanation: The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "As the result" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a result," which implies that the outcome is one of several.

4. Error: of, Correction: (none)
Explanation: Unnecessary word. If you were using "in spite" it would be okay to write "in spite of the distance", but "of" is not necessary when using "despite".

5. Error: more, Correction: (none)
Explanation: "More" is never used with "easier" because

Label: 1. The list is talking about things in general, and so "status" should be pluralised to match "conversations", "blogs" and "photos".




Error_sentence: Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other 's permission , this should not be placed or implanted to anyone .

1. Error: other 's, Correction: 
Explanation: As "permission" is something granted by another person, this is already taken for granted without needing to explicitly say "other's".

2. Error:  , Correction: technology
Explanation: You should explicitly state "technology" for clarity.

3. Error: to, Correction: in
Explanation: An implant goes inside the body, so you need to use "in" accordingly.

Erroneous sentence: Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .

1. Error: check, Correction: checks
Explanation: From the sentence we can surmise that the people would have more than one check, so the plural "checks" should be used.

Erroneous sentence: This can protect the students from
cleaned: 1. Error: other 's, Correction:
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.




Error_sentence: These implants and products are also been used as surveillance tools .
Correct_sentence: These implants and products have also been used as surveillance tools .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: , products, Correction: . Products
Explanation: Use a full stop to separate these two sentences.

2. Error: system, Correction: systems
Explanation: The sentence is talking about systems in general, so "system" should be pluralized.

3. Error: a, Correction: the
Explanation: The sentence is mentioning one specific decision, i.e., the correct one, so use the definite article, "the".

4. Error: of, Correction: 
Explanation: I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second.

5. Error: in, Correction: on
Explanation: When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities
cleaned: 1. Error: , products, Correction: . Products
Label: 1. The perfect present tense should be used to show that the action of using implants and products is currently still happening. To create the perfect present, we use "have" and the past participle "used." 




Error_sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .
Correct_sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring some negative effects on our daily lives .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: , Correction: for
The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.

2. Error: , Correction: the
With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.

3. Error: 1, Correction: 
The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.

2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
3. This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.

Correct_sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

Erroneous sentence: It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected .

1. Error: on, Correction:  
Explanation: Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".

2. Error: skill, Correction: skills
Explanation: This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.

Erroneous sentence: Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .

1. Error: immediate, Correction: immediately
Explanation: Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately".

Erroneous sentence: These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and
cleaned: 1. Error: on, Correction:
Label: 1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".




Error_sentence: With the aids of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily .
Correct_sentence: With the aid of social media , people bond globally , information flows rapidly , and humans live happily .
Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error:

1. Error: says, Correction: say
The subject here is the plural "people," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "say."

2. Error: the, Correction: 
The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.

3. Error: add-on, Correction: add-ons
The sentence is discussing add-ons in general, so "add-on" should be pluralized.

4. Error: others, Correction: other
"Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.

5. Error: aspect, Correction: role
Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".

6. Error:

Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "bond" to go with "people".
2. This sentence is talking about humans in general, so "human" should be pluralised.

4. "Aid" used in the sense of help or assistance is an uncountable noun and therefore should not be pluralised.

1. Error: bonds, Correction: bond
Explanation: Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "bond" to go with "people".

2. Error: human, Correction: humans
Explanation: This sentence is talking about humans in general, so "human" should be pluralised.

Explanation: Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "live" to go with "humans".

4. Error: aids, Correction: aid
Explanation: "Aid" used in the sense of help or assistance is an uncountable noun and therefore should not be pluralised.

Erroneous sentence: People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .

1. Error: length, Correction: lengths
Explanation: This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "

Erroneous sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .

1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.

Erroneous sentence: According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .

1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-re
cleaned: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.
Label: 1. The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so use the plural "groups".
2. This connects back to "family members" at the beginning of the sentence, so you need to use the plural, "are", as in "Family members are a crucial factor...".

Prediction: Here are the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence:

1. Error: of, Correction: for
The phrase "the reason for" is a common collocation in English, indicating the cause or explanation for something. In this sentence, "for" is used to indicate the reason why work stopped, which is that the authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary.

2. Error: , Correction: the
The definite article "the" is used to refer to a specific instance or thing. In this sentence, "the" is used to refer to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so it is necessary.

3. Error: , Correction: the
The definite article "the" is used to refer to a specific thing or instance. In this sentence, "the" is used to refer to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so it is necessary.

4. Error: of, Correction: 
The phrase "high level of" refers to physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of", the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.

And so on...
cleaned: 1. Error: of, Correction: for
Label: 1. This sentence is not using "thousand" as a specific number, i.e. 1,000, it is using it metaphorically to express a large, unspecified amount. In this case, it should be pluralised as "thousands".

Erroneous sentence: On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .

Explanation: As you are talking specifically about the next generation, use the definite article, "the", to indicate that you are referring to a specific, already mentioned generation.

Erroneous sentence: That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .

1. Error: elements, Correction: element
Explanation: The subject of the statement is "that", which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well. Since "that" is referring to one thing, use the singular form "element" instead of the plural form "elements".

Erroneous sentence: I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago .

1. Error: on, Correction: in
Explanation: Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the
cleaned: 1. Error:  , Correction: the
Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.
