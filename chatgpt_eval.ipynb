There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so \"qualified\" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to \"human resources with creative thinking abilities,\" but \"creative human resources\" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.\n",

      "One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .\n",
      "1. The noun \"disadvantage\" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase \"one of\" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.\n",

The phrase \"lose interest in\" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and \"loss\" is a noun, so it should be changed to \"lose.\"\n",
      "3. The phrase \"lose interest in\" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article \"in.\" The phrase \"lose interest of\" is incorrect, and it would mean that the \"interest\" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. The phrase \"lose interest in\" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article \"in.\" The phrase \"lose interest of\" is incorrect, and it would mean that the \"interest\" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.\n",

      "1. \"Reimbursement\" is a noun, and therefore should not have the verb \"is\".\n",

      "\n",
      "1. \"When\" is used to indicate the time at which something happens, and \"while\" is used to indicate the time during which something happens. In this case, \"when\" is used because the author is discussing the time at which people in the same field use social media sites.\n",

      "2. Incorrect conjugation. \"Research\" is treated as the third person singular, so use \"shows\" to correspond with it.\n",

      "2. The definite article \"the\" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.\n",

      "3. The definite article \"the\" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The phrase \"high level of\" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition \"of,\" the compound adjective \"high-level\" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition \"of\" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.\n",

      "1. The phrase \"to put it in a nutshell\" means \"to summarize the main point in a few words.\" The word \"nutshell\" is a metaphor for a small box that contains a nut. The metaphor is not used in the phrase, so the word \"the\" should not be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The phrase \"between parents and their children\" is a prepositional phrase that modifies \"communication.\" The phrase should be placed as close as possible to the word it modifies. \n",

      "1. The verb \"connect\" is in the present tense, so it should be in the third person singular. \"Connects\" is the correct form.\n",

      "2. Missing word. The correct expression is \"get in contact\".\n",

      "2. \"Us\" is a pronoun, and pronouns are always singular. The word \"people\" is a plural noun. Therefore, the pronoun must be plural as well.\n",

      "2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, \"use\".\n",

      "1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense \"passed\" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense \"passes\" should be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The verb \"have\" is used for possession, so it is incorrect to use it to describe a situation. \"Have\" should be changed to \"have little motivation to work hard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The phrase \"As a result\" is used to introduce the conclusion of a piece of writing. In this case, the conclusion is that students have less interest in science and technology, so \"As a result\" should be placed before that conclusion, not after it.\n",

      "2. The phrase \"which may lead to the lack of talented people in the future\" is awkward. It should be \"which may lead to a lack of talented people in the future.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The phrase \"for they have\" is an archaic way of saying \"because they have.\" If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as \"because they have little motivation to work hard.\" If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Using the future tense \"will\" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say \"they have.\"\n",

      "1. The subject of the sentence is \"you\", which is singular, so the verb should be singular.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. The noun \"experience\" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.\n",

      "2. The word \"each\" means \"every one of two or more.\" The phrase \"each other\" is used to refer to two or more people, or two or more things, who are interacting with each other. When there is only one person or one thing, the phrase \"to each other\" is used.\n",

      "2. The verb \"face\" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"Happen\" is a transitive verb, which means that it requires a direct object. \"Happen\" can be used with \"to\" or \"for\" as a preposition, but not with \"to\". The sentence should be rephrased to avoid the use of \"to\". For example, \"Since this happens more often in countries which are much larger than Singapore, it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child without knowing where the child has been brought to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"It\" is a pronoun, and it must be a subject or an object. \"It\" cannot be a subject in the sentence, so the pronoun must be replaced with a noun. \"Happen\" is a transitive verb, so the direct object should be a noun. The sentence should be rephrased to avoid the use of \"it\".

      "\n",
      "3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular \"country\" to the plural \"countries.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The be verb \"is\" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject \"countries\" is plural, and so the be verb \"is\" must be changed to its appropriate form: \"are.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. \"Find\" does not need the adverb \"back\" to convey the implied meaning here. \"Find back\" is not a common phrase.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The phrase \"usually associated with\" is a common collocation. It is not necessary to use \"is usually associated with\" in the sentence, since the subject is already a singular noun.\n",

      "2. Incorrect conjugation. \"Privacy issues\" is the third person plural, so use \"have\" to correspond with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Incorrect word. The correct expression is \"in the first place\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how \"short\" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say \"shorter\" here, in the same way as you can ask \"How short is this?\" but you can't ask \"How shorter is this?\".\n",
      "\n",
      "3. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as \"go to any length\". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, \"make their words as short as they can\", and as that means there are many things that they might try, \"lengths\" should be pluralised to reflect this.\n",

      "2. While the phrase \"under risk of\" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say \"at risk of,\" because the preposition \"at\" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.\n",

      "3. While the phrase \"under risk of\" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say \"at risk of,\" because the preposition \"at\" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is \"running\" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The definite article \"the\" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article \"a\" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. \"The genetic testing result\" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be \"a genetic testing result,\" which implies that the outcome is\n",

      "1. The singular \"people\" refers to a group of people as a whole. The plural \"people\" refers to each individual person.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The adjective \"qualified\" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so \"qualified\" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to \"human resources with creative thinking abilities,\" but \"creative human resources\" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"For\" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while \"to\" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The incorrect sentence uses \"and\" but the ideas of \"not be easily available to the public\" and \"taken for granted\" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things \"should\" happen, so the conjunction \"or\" is more appropriate.\n",

      "2. The word \"network\" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \"Prevent\" is a transitive verb and therefore needs an object. \"Employees\" is the object of the verb \"prevent\".\n",

      "2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural \"networks\" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular \"network.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The phrase \"prevent from\" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, \"spend\" should be changed to \"spending.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. When talking about \"time spent,\" English uses the preposition \"in\" for physical locations and \"on\" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so \"on\" is appropriate here. \n",

      "\n",
      "2. The concept of \"personal morals\" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, \"the personal morals of an individual.\"\n",

      "1. The plural \"people\" is being used to refer to a single person, which is incorrect. The plural \"people\" is used when referring to a group of people. Use \"person\" when referring to a single person.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. When referencing relationships as a general concept, the plural \"relationships\" should be used because it references multiple relationships between many different people. The singular \"relationship\" is used to refer to individual relationships, with \"a relationship\" meaning any relationship and \"the relationship\" meaning one relationship specifically.\n",

      "1. \"Safeguarding\" is a more appropriate word than \"invading\" because the surveillance technology is not used to attack the privacy of people. It is used to protect people's privacy. \"Safeguarding\" is a more common word to describe this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"Shall\" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. \"Shall\" is too formal. \"Should\" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so \"should not\" is used. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"For\" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while \"to\" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action.

      "3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural \"images\" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular \"image\" is used to refer to an individual image, with \"an image\" meaning any image and \"the image\" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by \"people,\" which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.\n",

      "4. The concept of \"social media\" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition \"on\" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.\n",

      "1. The phrase \"study in oversea\" is not a grammatically correct expression. The word \"oversea\" is an adjective that means \"across the sea,\" and is used to describe countries, people, or things. It is not a noun and cannot be used to describe a person's location.\n",

      "3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural \"friends\" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular \"friend\" is used to refer to an individual friend, with \"a friend\" meaning any friend and \"the friend\" meaning one specific friend.\n",

      "2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural \"have\" to go with \"humans\".\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The definite article \"the\" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the album in general, not a specific one. The definite article conveys that the album in question was used in general, not for other things.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The definite article \"the\" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to her own privacy in general, not a specific one. The definite article conveys that her own privacy in question was used in general, not for other things.\n",

      "2. The sentence starts with \"He\", referring to man, but the third person possessive you have used is the female version. Change to \"his\" to match with \"He\" and make it clear that you are talking about a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"One's\" is the possessive form of the pronoun \"one\". When the possessive form of a pronoun is used, the word \"one\" is not repeated. For example, \"one's\" is the possessive form of \"one\", so you would not say \"one's one's opinion\".\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"The\" is the definite article, and it is used to indicate that the noun it precedes is one specific thing. In this case, \"the education system\" is not specific, because there are many different education systems in the world. Therefore, \"the\" should be omitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"Can\" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, \"can better prepare\", should be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Use \"provides\" instead of \"provide\" because it is a single action, and \"provides\" is the third-person singular form of the verb \"to provide.\"\n",

      "1. Missing article. As our planet is a countable noun but also the only one we know of, we call it \"the world\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Incorrect form. \"Latest\" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the noun \"news\", so you need to use the adverb form, \"latest\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The plural noun \"factors\" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing factors as a general concept, the plural \"factors\" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular \"factor\" is used to refer to an individual factor, with \"a factor\" meaning any factor and \"the factor\" meaning one factor specifically.\n",

      "3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, \"current\" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group.

The correct way to fix this is to change \"on\" to \"one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb \"cater to\" requires an object, which here is \"desired deeds.\" Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase \"desired deeds\" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like \"what others desire.\"\n",

      "2. The word \"pregnant\" is a singular noun, so the subject-verb agreement is \"will know\" rather than \"will know about\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"End\" here is a noun that goes with \"cause\", and it requires an article before it in the same way as \"cause the death\". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use \"the\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"In particularly for\" does not make sense, it is correct here to use \"particularly\" on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. When used in the context of \"face-to-face human contact\", \"contact\" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an \"s\" at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The phrase \"this is because\" is used to explain a cause for something, which is not the case here. The phrase \"this is because\" should be changed to \"this is because of,\" as it is being used to explain the cause of a feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"He or she\" is the plural, as it is used to refer to both male and female. Therefore, the pronoun should be changed to \"he or she\" to be consistent with the singular \"person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The phrase \"notice that\" is used to indicate the action of noticing something. Therefore, the phrase \"notice that\" should be changed to \"notice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The concept of \"users\" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain \"Group,\" \"Association,\" or similar words often have \"the\" added when used in a sentence, like \"the American Medical Association\" or \"the Sony Group.\" But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Incorrect word. \"Dinners\" is a plural noun, but \"having dinner\" is a singular verb. \"Having dinners\" is a plural verb. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Incorrect form. \"Having\" is a verb, and is used with the infinitive form of another verb, so you need to use \"to\" with \"chatting\" in the sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"Social network site\" is an uncountable noun and should not have the article \"the.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The word \"willing\" means a desire to do something, but it is not commonly used in modern English. The word \"willingness\" is a more commonly used word to express this meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The best way to learn a language is to live in a country where that language is spoken .\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The subject of the sentence is \"the best way.\" \"To\" is a preposition that is used to indicate the object of a verb, so it is needed in this sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so \"skill\" should be pluralised.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The subject is \"children,\" which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so \"parents\" should be plural too.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The sentence is saying that the user cannot use the system if it is broken. The word \"at all\" is redundant and unnecessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The word \"it\" should not be used to refer to \"technology,\" as \"technology\" is an abstract concept and cannot be used as a subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"So\" is used to indicate that the previous sentence is the reason for the following one. In this case, the reason for the following sentence is that the manufacturer is one of the investors, so the sentence should be \"So, the manufacturer is one of the major investors that is providing the fund.\" In this case, \"so\" is not needed, as it is implied.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The company is not the subject of the sentence, so it should not be capitalised.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \"For example\" is used to give an example of something, so it should not be used here. You are not giving an example of a manufacturer, you are talking about the manufacturer, so just say, \"for example, the company that innovators are working for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"Carrier\" is a countable noun, so it should be pluralised to \"carriers\".\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \"Family\" is a countable noun, so it should be pluralised to \"families\".\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"Social media\" is a countable noun, so it should not be pluralised.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"Communication\" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralised.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"People\" is a countable noun, so it should be pluralised to \"people\".\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The possessive \"innovators\" is used to show that the challenges are associated with the innovators, not the innovators themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. The present tense should be used to show that the challenges are currently still happening. To create the present tense, we use \"are\" and the present participle \"dealing with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The article \"a\" is used to refer to a single entity. In this case, \"the book 1984\" is a single entity, so \"a\" is not needed. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. The possessive \"Orwell's\" is used to show that the book was written by Orwell, not by someone else. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. The book is not a single entity, so \"the book 1984\" is not needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"Society\" is a noun and does not need to be capitalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The word \"altitude\" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is \"attitude,\" meaning a way of thinking or feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The verb \"care\" requires the preposition \"for\" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. With the definite article \"the,\" the phrase \"the secondary school\" refers to a specific secondary school. \"Secondary school\" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general \"secondary school\" is a better choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The phrase \"the top student\" is a common phrase meaning \"the number-one student.\" The adjective \"top\" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article \"the,\" which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The simple past tense \"been\" should be changed to the present perfect tense \"have been.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The simple past tense \"think\" should be changed to the past perfect tense \"thought.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Unnecessary comma. The position of the comma is grammatically incorrect.\n",

      "1. The simple past tense \"think\" should be changed to the past perfect tense \"thought.\"\n",

      "2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so \"life\" should be pluralised.\n",

      "3. This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so \"effect\" should be pluralised.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is \"immediately\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. This sentence is talking about humans in general, so \"human\" should be pluralised.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural \"live\" to go with \"humans\".\n",
      "\n",
      "4. \"Aid\" used in the sense of help or assistance is an uncountable noun and therefore should not be pluralised.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The word \"really\" is not necessary here. It is used in this sentence to emphasize the previous sentence, but it is not necessary because it is already clear that genetic testing helps people. You can simply remove \"really\" from the sentence and it will still make sense.\n",

      "2. This connects back to \"family members\" at the beginning of the sentence, so you need to use the plural, \"are\", as in \"Family members are a crucial factor...\".\n",

      "2. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.\n",
      "\n",

      "4. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The indefinite article \"a\" refers to one thing, so the phrase \"create a better material\" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say \"create better material,\" in which \"material\" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or \"create better materials,\" in which \"materials\" can refer to various building materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \"Building\" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article \"the\" when referred to in a general sense. \"The\" is used with \"buildings\" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. \"Despite\" means in spite of or not being affected by something. \"During\" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, \"during\" should be used instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural \"disasters\" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular \"disaster\" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with \"a disaster\" meaning any disaster and \"the disaster\" meaning one specific disaster.\n",
