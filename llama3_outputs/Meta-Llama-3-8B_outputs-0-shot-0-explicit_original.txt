Prediction:  1. The word qualified is missing in the erroneous sentence. 2. The word human resources is missing in the erroneous sentence.
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle. 




Prediction:  1. The word "side" is replaced by the word "hand" as the word "hand" is more suitable in this context. 2. The word "want" is replaced by the word "wants" as the word "want" is in the simple present tense and the word "wants" is in the simple present tense. 3. The word "can" is replaced by the word "choose" as the word "can" is a modal verb and the word "choose" is a main verb. 4. The word "confirm" is replaced by the word "confirm and has been prepared to face the result" as the word "confirm" is a verb and the phrase "confirm and has been prepared to face the result" is a verb phrase. 5. The word "genetic testing" is replaced by the word "genetic testing individually" as the word "genetic testing" is a noun and the phrase "genetic testing individually" is a noun phrase.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.Erroneous sentence: On the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Prediction:  1) In the given sentence, the word “that” is used in the wrong place. The word “that” should be used after the word “disadvantages” and not after the word “concerns”. 2) In the given sentence, the word “loss” is used in the wrong place. The word “loss” should be used after the word “interest” and not after the word “people”. 3) In the given sentence, the word “interest” is used in the wrong place. The word “interest” should be used after the word “face-to-face communication” and not after the word “loss”.
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.




Prediction:  1. shall not be made available to the public should be changed to should not be made available to the public. 2. easy abuse and distorted usage should be changed to easy abuse and distorted use.
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 




Prediction:  1. The correct word is "for" not "with". 2. The correct word is "reimbursement" not "reimbursement". 3. The correct word is "companies" not "companies". 4. The correct word is "cash" not "cash".
Explanation: The word "for" is used to indicate the purpose of something. It is used to express the reason for doing something. The word "with" is used to indicate a person or thing that is involved in something. It is used to express the presence of a person or thing. The word "reimbursement" is used to indicate the act of paying back something that has been paid for. It is used to express the act of paying back money that has been spent. The word "companies" is used to indicate a group of people or things that are working together. It is used to express a group of people or things that are working together. The word "cash" is used to indicate money that is in the form of coins or notes. It is used to express money that is in the form of coins or notes.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.Erroneous sentence
Label: 1. The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.




Prediction:  The first sentence has two errors. First, the word “researches” should be singular since it is the subject of the sentence. Second, the word “among” should be replaced with “between” since it is used to refer to a relationship between two things. The second sentence has one error. The word “people” should be plural since it is the subject of the sentence.
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Prediction:  1) the reason of halt of work -> the reason for the halt of the work
2) the higher level of authorities -> the higher level authorities
3) thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin -> thought an underground traffic system was not necessary in Harbin
4) Some evidences showed that -> It was showed that
5) Some evidences showed that -> It was showed that
6) Some evidences showed that -> It was showed that
7) Some evidences showed that -> It was showed that
8) Some evidences showed that -> It was showed that
9) Some evidences showed that -> It was showed that

16) Some evidences showed that -> It was showed that
17) Some evidences showed that -> It was showed that
18) Some evidences showed that -> It was showed that
19) Some
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.




Prediction:  1. There should be a capital letter at the beginning of the sentence.
2. There should be a full stop at the end of the sentence.
3. The word 'cyber' is written in lower case. It should be written in upper case.
4. There is an extra space before the word 'police'.
5. There is an extra space after the word 'cyber'.
6. The word 'these' is used twice. It should be used only once.
7. The word 'cyber' is used twice. It should be used only once.

15. There is an extra space after the word 'these'.
16. There is an extra space after the word 'hoaxes'.
17. There is an extra space after the word 'spreading'.
18.
Label: 1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".




Prediction:  The error is the use of the word “come” instead of “comes” in the sentence. The error is the use of the word “device” instead of “devices” in the sentence. The error is the use of the word “he/she” instead of “he or she” in the sentence.
The explanation for each error is written in a simple and concise manner. The explanations are written in a way that is easy to understand and follow.

Label: 1. The subject is "he/she," which is singular, so the verb should be singular for subject-verb agreement.




Prediction:  The word “the” is missing after “children”. The word “rely” is not the right word. The word “parent” is not the right word. The word “live” is not the right word.
Input: The children rely the parent to live .
Output: The word “the” is missing after “children”.

Output: The word “parent” is not the right word.
Input: The children rely the parent to live .
Output: The word “live” is not the right word.
Input: The children rely the parent to live .
Output: The word “the” is missing after “children”.
Input:
Label: 1. Missing word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. This sentence is either referring to the parents of specific children, or parents and children in general, but either way, "parents" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  1. It is a noun phrase and not a verb phrase. 2. The word ‘nutshell’ is a noun and not a verb. 3. The word ‘it’ is an object and not a subject. 4. The word ‘to’ is a preposition and not a verb. 5. The word ‘put’ is a verb and not a noun. 6. The word ‘in’ is a preposition and not a verb. 7. The word ‘the’ is a determiner and not a verb. 8. The word ‘good’ is an adjective and not a verb. 9. The word ‘their’ is a possessive adjective and not a verb. 10. The word ‘health’ is a noun and not a verb.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.Erroneous sentence: To put it in the nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .
Correct sentence: To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health .

Label: 1. "In a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. The phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but the specificity of "the" makes it sound literal. Instead of referring figuratively to something very simple, it would mean something that is literally inside a nutshell.




Prediction:  The phrase about the should be replaced with the . The phrase in our daily life should be replaced with in our daily lives .
Note: You can use any of the following punctuation marks: , ; : ? !
Note: The explanations can be in any order.
Note: There is no need to print the erroneous sentence and the correct sentence in the output.
The first line contains the number of test cases T.
Each of the next T lines contains the erroneous sentence and its correction.
Label: 1. "Discuss" does not need to be followed by a preposition.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  1. 's should be replaced by 's 2. connect should be replaced by connects

Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Prediction:  1. The word phones should be phone 2. The word accidentally should be accidentally damaged 3. The word can also should be can also be 4. The word to get contact should be to get in contact 5. The word our should be my
Label: 1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. Missing word. The correct expression is "get in contact".




Prediction: 1. Addons instead of add-on2. Of instead of for3. Add a comma after chatting service4. Add a comma after media of sharing5. Add a space after message and chatting service6. Add a space after personal profile7. Add a space after media of sharing8. Add a space after entertainment add-ons9. Add a space after i.e .
Your task is to write a program that will output the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Label: 1. The sentence is discussing add-ons in general, so "add-on" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  (1) The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us . The word “it” is not mentioned in the sentence. (2) The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us . The word “over” is not mentioned in the sentence. (3) The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us . The word “on” is not mentioned in the sentence. (4) The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us . The word “they” is not mentioned in the sentence.
Explanation: The word “they” is not mentioned in the sentence.
Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.




Prediction:  Therefore is a conjunction that links two sentences. It is used to show the relationship between two sentences. In the erroneous sentence, it is used to link a noun phrase with a verb phrase. It is incorrect because it is not used to link a noun phrase with a verb phrase. The correct sentence is the following: Therefore, I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child . The correct sentence is the following: Therefore, I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child . The correct sentence is the following: Therefore, I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child . The correct sentence is the following: Therefore, I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child . The correct sentence is the following: Therefore, I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child . The correct sentence is the following: Therefore, I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child . The correct sentence is the following: Therefore, I believe the parents have the right to know the healthiness of their child . The correct sentence is the following: Therefore, I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child .
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".




Prediction:  "belive" is not a word. "it" is not a word here. "still" is not a word here.
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "believe."




Prediction:  1. To do research and design: verb phrase
2. For they will have little motivation to work hard: subject-verb agreement
3. And they have little motivation to work hard: coordination
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."




Prediction:  1. This is the correct form of the word 'other' (with an 'e' at the end). 2. The word 'without' is used to indicate that something is not present. 3. The word 'this' refers to the technology that should not be placed or implanted. 4. The word 'anyone' refers to a person who should not have the technology placed or implanted.
Label: 1. As "permission" is something granted by another person, this is already taken for granted without needing to explicitly say "other's". 
2. You should explicitly state "technology" for clarity.
3. An implant goes inside the body, so you need to use "in" accordingly.




Prediction:  I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore .
1. “invoving” is an error, it should be “involving”.
2. “one years ago” is an error, it should be “one year ago”.
3. “I just arrived singapore” is an error, it should be “I just arrived in singapore”.
You are given a file containing erroneous sentences and their corrections. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Label: 1. The phrase "one year" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "years," so it should be the singular "year."




Prediction:  1. The word “thought” should be replaced by “think” because “thought” is a past tense verb and the sentence is in the present tense. 2. The word “genetic” should be replaced by “genetic risk” because “genetic” is an adjective and “genetic risk” is a noun. 3. The word “his” should be replaced by “his or her” because “his” is a pronoun and “his or her” is a pronoun. 4. The word “or” should be replaced by “or relatives” because “or” is a conjunction and “or relatives” is a noun phrase.
Label: 1. You are expressing an opinion that you hold now, not something that you thought in the past, so you should use the present tense, "think".




Prediction:  "Erroneous sentence: Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies for spying and advertising .

Label: 1. This is the passive voice, continuing from the phrase "is recorded." The passive voice requires a form of the verb "to be" followed by a secondary verb, which is always the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "transfer" to the past participle "transferred."

20. There is a missing letter in
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."
2. The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.




Prediction:  1. The word 'more' is redundant. 2. The word 'than' should be replaced by 'than' (the verb 'asking' should be replaced by 'to ask').

Label: 1. "More" is never used with "easier" because "easier" already contains the sense of it being "more".




Prediction:  1) the internet should be written as internet because it is a singular noun. 2) were should be written as was because it is a singular verb.
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Prediction:  1. The word “with” should be “to” 2. “face to” should be “face their”
Note: The input and output sentences may not be in the same order.
Label: 1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.




Prediction:  That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
1. Elements is a plural form of element.
2. The is a singular form of the.
3. Overcome is a verb.
Label: 1. The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.




Prediction:  1. The erroneous sentence contains a plural noun (countries) which should be a singular noun (country). 2. The erroneous sentence contains a relative pronoun (which) which should be a relative clause (that is much larger than Singapore). 3. The erroneous sentence contains a preposition (in) which should be a conjunction (because). 4. The erroneous sentence contains a conjunction (which) which should be a relative pronoun (that). 5. The erroneous sentence contains a preposition (to) which should be a verb (to find). 6. The erroneous sentence contains a preposition (to) which should be a verb (to bring). 7. The erroneous sentence contains a preposition (to) which should be a verb (to know).
Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.




Prediction:  The word “challenges” should be replaced with “challenge” because “challenges” is plural, but “challenge” is singular. The word “for” should be replaced with “to” because “for” is used in the phrase “for the innovators,” but “to” is used in the phrase “to the innovators.”
Label: 1. The pronoun "another" means "one more," so it is singular and cannot be used with the plural "challenges." The singular "challenge" should be used instead.




Prediction:  1. The word privacy is pluralized to privacy issues in the correct sentence. 2. The word place is changed to in the first place in the correct sentence.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.Erroneous sentence: In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
Correct sentence: In addition , privacy issues have become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share in the first place .
Explanations: 1. The word privacy is pluralized to privacy issues in the correct sentence. 2. The word place is changed to in the first place in the correct sentence.
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about privacy issues in general, so "issue" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Privacy issues" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
3. Incorrect word. The correct expression is "in the first place".




Prediction:  (1) has → have (2) is → are (3) runing → running (4) cost of runing → cost of running (5) to see whether → to see if (6) know → knows
Note: You may assume that the erroneous input sentence is grammatically correct and that the correction is the correct sentence.
Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.




Prediction:  1) The preposition ‘down’ is replaced by ‘to’.
2) The word ‘it’ is replaced by ‘the genetic risk’.
3) The word ‘just’ is replaced by ‘the’.
4) The word ‘one’ is replaced by ‘more than one’.
5) The word ‘family’ is replaced by ‘families’.
On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family .
Label: 1. Missing article. As you are talking specifically about the next generation, use the definite article, "the".




Prediction:  1. The subject of the sentence is "The social network" and it should be "the people" because the verb "create" is singular. 2. "creativ" should be "creat" 3. "impacts" should be "impact" because it is singular.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Erroneous sentence: The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people .
Correct sentence: The social network may also creat some negative impacts for people .
Explanations: 1. The subject of the sentence is "The social network" and it should be "the people" because the verb "create" is singular. 2. "creativ" should be "creat" 3. "impacts" should be "impact" because it is singular.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Erroneous sentence: The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people .
Correct sentence: The social network may also creat some negative impacts for people .
Explanations: 1. The subject of the sentence is "The social network" and it
Label: 1. The concept of "people" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of people instead of to people in general.




Prediction:  1. The word "shall" is used in the imperative form. The correct form is "should". 2. The phrase "for the public" is redundant. 3. The phrase "taken for granted" is redundant.
Your program should read from standard input, and write to standard output. The input consists of a single line, which contains the erroneous sentence, followed by a single line, which contains the correct sentence. Your program should output a list of explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence, in the order in which they appear. Each explanation should be a single line, containing the explanation text, and the position of the error in the erroneous sentence (in the form "Error at position <position>"), where <position> is the position of the first character of the erroneous word.
The input is guaranteed to contain at least one error. The erroneous sentence will contain no more than 100 words, and the correct sentence will contain no more than 100 words. Each word will contain at least 1 and no more than 20 characters. Each word will consist of only letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), and hyphens (-). All words will be separated by a single space.
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.




Prediction: 1. In the first sentence, the word ‘ corporate ’ is used as an adjective. In the second sentence, it is used as a noun. The correct usage is as a noun.
2. In the first sentence, the phrase ‘ social media network ’ is used incorrectly. In the second sentence, the phrase ‘ social media networks ’ is used correctly. The correct usage is as a plural noun.
3. In the first sentence, the word ‘ prevent ’ is used as a verb. In the second sentence, it is used as a noun. The correct usage is as a noun.
4. In the first sentence, the word ‘ employees ’ is used as a noun. In the second sentence, it is used as a verb. The correct usage is as a verb.
5. In the first sentence, the phrase ‘ spending their office time ’ is used incorrectly. In the second sentence, the phrase ‘ spending their office time on their personal leisure ’ is used correctly. The correct usage is as a prepositional phrase.
6. In the first sentence, the word ‘ than ’ is used as a conjunction. In the second sentence, it is used as a preposition. The correct usage is as a preposition.
7. In the first sentence, the
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."




Prediction:  1. The word "the" is missing before the word "more". 2. The word "on" is missing before the word "social media sites".
Erroneous sentence: The number of the students who have taken the English course are 150 .

Correct sentence: The number of the students who have taken the English course is 150 .
Explanation: The word "are" should be changed to "is".
Erroneous sentence: The number of the students who have taken the
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Prediction:  1. The sentence does not have a subject, it is missing the word "we". 2. The sentence does not have a verb, it is missing the word "have". 3.

Label: 1. Unnecessary word. If you were using "in spite" it would be okay to write "in spite of the distance", but "of" is not necessary when using "despite".




Prediction:  1. The word 'the' is not used before 'social media'. 2. The word 'is' is repeated. 3. The word 'people' is not used in plural form.
Label: 1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.

Explanations: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal moral morals the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Correct sentence: Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends
Label: 1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."




Prediction:  (1) the word tend should be tend to (2) the word send should be sends (3) the word wishes should be wish (4) the word promts should be prompts (5) the word someone should be some one (6) the word birthday should be birthdays (7) the word is should be are (8) the word Today should be Today's

Constraints: The input sentence will not have more than 100 words.
Explanation: The word tend should be tend to.
Explanation: The word send should be sends.
Explanation: The word wishes should be wish.
Explanation: The word promts should be prompts.
Explanation: The word someone should be some one.
Explanation: The word birthday should be birthdays.
Explanation: The word is should be are.
Explanation: The word Today should be Today's.
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "birthday wishes." Either "birthday wishes" or "a birthday wish" would be acceptable.




Prediction:  There are 3 errors in the erroneous sentence. First, the word "another" is used as an adjective but should be used as a pronoun. Second, the word "thoughts" is misspelled as "thought". Third, the word "personalities" is misspelled as "personality".
Output: The first error is that the word "another" is used as an adjective but should be used as a pronoun. The second error is that the word "thoughts" is misspelled as "thought". The third error is that the word "personalities" is misspelled as "personality".
Explanation: The first error is that the word "another" is used as an adjective but should be used as a pronoun. The second error is that the word "thoughts" is misspelled as "thought". The third error is that the word "personalities" is misspelled as "personality".
Label: 1. The singular noun "thought" refers to a single idea or opinion. For example, "I think I'd like eggs for breakfast" or "She thinks it would be fun to try beekeeping" are two thoughts. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "thoughts" should be pluralized.
2. The singular noun "personality" means a collection of traits, behaviors, or emotional qualities that make up an individual's character. The plural noun "personalities" refers to the personalities of multiple people.




Prediction:  1. The word 's in the erroneous sentence is not a contraction of the possessive form of the pronoun 'he' . It is the contraction of the possessive form of the pronoun 'his' . The correct possessive form of the pronoun 'he' is 'his' . 2. The word 'people' in the erroneous sentence is the plural form of the noun 'person' . The correct form of the noun 'people' is 'person' . 3. The word 'life' in the erroneous sentence is the singular form of the noun 'lives' . The correct form of the noun 'life' is 'lives' .
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.Erroneous sentence: These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Correct sentence: These social media makes people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Explanations: 1. The word 's in the erroneous sentence is not a contraction of the possessive form of the pronoun 'he' . It is the contraction of the possessive form of the pronoun 'his' . The correct possess
Label: 1. The sentence mentions multiple people, so "life" should be pluralised, as there are multiple lives.

Label: 1. This sentence is saying that one cannot understand a person "through the means of" stalking their Facebook page, and so you need to use "by" here to express the same meaning. It is being used in the same way as "He came by train".




Prediction:  (1) , thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed . -> , thus they will make the right decision after they have been informed . (2) Parents know what the best is for their children , -> Parents know what is best for their children ,

I have read the error but I am not sure how to write the explanation for the second error.
Erroneous sentence: Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have be
Label: 1. The sentence is mentioning one specific decision, i.e., the correct one, so use the definite article, "the".




Prediction:  1. In the sentence, “social media in the contemporary society” should be “social media in contemporary society”. The adjective “contemporary” should be placed after the noun “society”. 2. The word “one” should be changed to “people”. The word “one” is singular, while the word “people” is plural. 3. The word “improve” should be changed to “improve”. The word “improve” is a verb, while the word “improvement” is a noun. 4. The word “as well as” should be changed to “as well as”. The word “as well as” should be followed by a comma. 5. The word “disseminate” should be changed to “disseminate”. The word “disseminate” is a verb, while the word “dissemination” is a noun. 6. The word “the masses” should be changed to “the masses”. The word “the masses” should be followed by a comma.
Label: 1. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.
2. When referencing relationships as a general concept, the plural "relationships" should be used because it references multiple relationships between many different people. The singular "relationship" is used to refer to individual relationships, with "a relationship" meaning any relationship and "the relationship" meaning one relationship specifically.




Prediction:  1. he or she concurently has knowledge about others 2. as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.Erroneous sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about others .
Correct sentence: This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has knowledge about others .
Explanations: 1. he or she concurently has knowledge about others 2. as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile
Label: 1. "Knowledge" is an uncountable and abstract noun, so it cannot be made singular or plural, thus it cannot be used with the indefinite article 'a.'




Prediction: 1. The word “obvioualy” is misspelled. The correct spelling is “obviously”.
2. The sentence “it is obvioualy that many advantages have been brought to our lives” is incorrect. The correct sentence is “it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives”.
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "obvious." Also, it looks like the author intended to use the word "obviously," which is an adverb. Adverbs are used to modify verbs, but in this sentence, the word follows "it is" and therefore should be a noun.




Prediction:  1. Though social media do create relationships -> Though social media does create relationships
2. relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction -> relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.Erroneous sentence: Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction .

Explanations: 1. Though social media do create relationships -> Though social media does create relationships
2. relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction -> relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction
Label: 1. The subject here is "social media," which is collective and treated as singular, so the verb should be "does" for subject verb agreement.




Prediction:  1. “or” is missing after “afraid” 2. “be” is missing before “afraid”
Label: 1. The first "be" in the sentence can be used for both "shy" and "afraid", you do not need to repeat it for "afraid".




Prediction:  1. " but " is replaced by " and " 2. " him or her " is replaced by " him or her and "
Explanations: 1. " guys " is replaced by " guy " 2. " may " is replaced by " might "
Explanations: 1. " with " is replaced by " on " 2. " facebook " is replaced by " Facebook "
Label: 1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.




Prediction:  1. come up with + NP : The phrase come up with is followed by a noun phrase, which is a phrase that includes a noun and any modifiers. In this case, the phrase that follows come up with is an effective policy , which is a noun phrase.
2. change + NP : The verb change is followed by a noun phrase, which is a phrase that includes a noun and any modifiers. In this case, the phrase that follows change is its education system , which is a noun phrase.
3. stimulate + NP : The verb stimulate is followed by a noun phrase, which is a phrase that includes a noun and any modifiers. In this case, the phrase that follows stimulate is innovation , which is a noun phrase.

5. become + NP : The verb become is followed by a noun phrase, which is a phrase that includes a noun and any modifiers. In this case, the phrase that follows become is even faster , which is a noun phrase.
6. can + VP :
Label: 1. The noun "policy" requires either an article or pluralization. The definite article "the" refers to a specific policy, especially one that was mentioned earlier in the text. Because no such policy was mentioned, it should be changed to the indefinite article "a," which refers to one single unspecified policy out of multiple potential policies, or alternately to the plural "policies," which means multiple unspecified policies.




Prediction:  1) The word “ decades ” is in the plural form , but it should be in the singular form . 2) The phrase “ when the social media sites are not yet fully developed ” should be “ when the social media sites were not yet fully developed ” . 3) The phrase “ people connect with others who live far away ” should be “ people connected with others who lived far away ” . 4) The phrase “ by using a phone , or even a letter ” should be “ by using a phone , or even a letter ” .
Explanation: The word “ decades ” is in the plural form , but it should be in the singular form .
Explanation: The phrase “ when the social media sites are not yet fully developed ” should be “ when the social media sites were not yet fully developed ” .
Explanation: The phrase “ people connect with others who live far away ” should be “ people connected with others who lived far away ” .
Explanation: The phrase “ by using a phone , or even a letter ” should be “ by using a phone , or even a letter ” .
Label: 1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."




Prediction:  1. The word "developed" is used instead of "developed." 2. The word "has" is used instead of "have." 3. The word "technology" is used instead of "technologies." 4. The word "advanced" is used instead of "advanced." 5. The word "been" is used instead of "being." 6. The word "developed" is used instead of "developed." 7.

The word "developed" is used instead of "developed." 17. The word
Label: 1. The technology to alter genetic material could be applied not just to a single gene but any and all genes. For that reason, it's correct to use the plural "genes" rather than the singular "gene."




Prediction:  1. The word ‘ due ’ should be replaced with ‘ because ’. 2. The word ‘ high-velocity ’ should be replaced with ‘ high ’.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Erroneous sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement .
Correct sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to high-velocity technological advancement .
Explanations: 1. The word ‘ due ’ should be replaced with ‘ because ’. 2. The word ‘ high-velocity ’ should be replaced with ‘ high ’.
Label: 1. The concept of "technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific advancement instead of the progress of technology in general.




Prediction:  1) The phrase “the face-to-face human contacts” is incorrect because it is a noun phrase. It should be a noun phrase. 2) The verb “has decresed” is incorrect because it is a past participle. It should be a past tense verb.
Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.




Prediction:  1. Researches shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing . (Correct: shows ) 2. Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing . (Correct: meeting ) 3. Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing . (Correct: that ) 4. Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing . (Correct: among ) 5. Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing . (Correct: been )
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.




Prediction:  1. Who is not a pronoun. 2. Essential is not an adjective. 3. Express is not a verb.

Output: 1. Who is not a pronoun. 2. Essential is not an adjective. 3. Express is not a verb.
Explanation: 1. Who is not a pronoun. 2. Essential is not an adjective. 3. Express is not a verb.
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the skill of writing) with regard to whom (a person).




Prediction:  In the given sentence, there are two errors. First, the word 'them' is used instead of 'people'. Second, the word 'against' is used instead of 'discriminate'.
Label: 1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."




Prediction:  1. and after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life : the subject of the verb to become is missing, i.e. the subject of the verb to become is products such as RFID tracking system . 2. products such as RFID tracking system have become real : the verb to become is redundant.

2. The sentence is talking about systems in general, so "system" should be pluralised.

Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. "Expressing themselves" is the third person singular, so use "becomes" to correspond with it.




Prediction:  The word 'from' is used as a preposition in the erroneous sentence, but it should be used as a conjunction in the correct sentence. The word 'real' is used as an adjective in the erroneous sentence, but it should be used as a noun in the correct sentence.
Explanation: The word 'real' is used as an adjective in the erroneous sentence, but it should be used as a noun in the correct sentence. The word 'life' is used as a noun in the erroneous sentence, but it should be used as an adjective in the correct sentence.
Explanation: The word 'real' is used as an adjective in the erroneous sentence, but it should be used as a noun in the correct sentence. The word 'life' is used as a noun in the erroneous sentence, but it should be used as an adjective in the correct sentence.

Explanation
Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".




Prediction:  1. The word “in” is missing before “society”. 2. The word “the” is missing before “society”.
The following is the sample input. The first line contains the erroneous sentence, and the second line contains the correct sentence.
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows .
The first line contains the number of test cases. Each test case is a pair of erroneous sentence and its correction.
For each test case, output the explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence, one explanation per line. The output must be in the format of “The word “word” is missing before “word”.”.
If the erroneous sentence and its correction are the same, output a single line with “No error.”.
3 The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
The word “in” is missing before “society”.
The word “the” is missing before “society”.
Label: 1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society, instead of the concept in general.




Prediction:  1. A possessive noun (Forest's) should be written with an apostrophe and an s. 2. A single quote (') is used to enclose a short quote in a sentence.
The first explanation is correct. The second explanation is wrong.
Label: 1. An "s" and a space are missing. There should be an "s" after the apostrophe and "view" should be a separate word.




Prediction:  - Great length is an error. The correct word is great lengths.
As shorter as they can is an error. The correct phrase is as short as they can.
Explanation: - The word "great" is spelled wrong. The correct spelling is "great."
Explanation: - The word "short" is spelled wrong. The correct spelling is "short."
Explanation: - The word "lengths" is spelled wrong. The correct spelling is "lengths."
Explanation: - The word "great" is spelled wrong. The correct spelling is "great."
Explanation: - The word "short" is spelled wrong. The correct spelling is "short."
Explanation: - The word "lengths" is spelled wrong. The correct spelling is "lengths."
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".




Prediction:  1) the word 'dignosis' is misspelled as 'diagnosis'. 2) the word 'can' is misspelled as 'choose'.
Label: 1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "diagnosis".
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "Secondly".

Correct sentence: The new system is not only convenient to use but also saves a lot of time .
Explanations: The erroneous sentence has a wrong word order in the second clause. The correct sentence has a correct
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.

Erroneous sentence: The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will
Label: 1. The construction "the earlier A, the better B" is talking about specifics, with a greater focus on B. As such, B requires an article, and as you are talking about something specific, you should use the definite article, "the".

Explanations: 1) As the result → As a result 2) telling the genetic testing result is needed → telling the genetic testing result is needed
You are given an erroneous
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "As the result" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a result," which implies that the outcome is one of several.

2. More support must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of such junction whether should him/her to inform the relatives.

Label: 1. In the context of care and aid from other people, the word "support" is an uncountable noun and is not pluralized. It generally refers to actions or gestures, which are not tangible and cannot be counted. The word "supports" is a verb form or a noun referring to the structural components of a building that allow it to withstand force.




Prediction:  1. The word "a" is missing before "research". 2. The word "that" is missing after "proven". 3. The word "users" is missing after "Facebook". 4. The word "that" is missing after "feel". 5. The word "users" is missing after "compare".
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. This sentence is talking about users in general and therefore should not have an article.
3. "Facebook" is a proper noun and therefore should not have an article.




Prediction:  1. means should be of 2. have should be have it 3. at risk for should be at risk of 4. so should be because 5. this problem should be treated seriously by the family should be this problem should be treated seriously by the family members
For each sentence, output the error type, the original word, the corrected word, and the sentence with the correction.
1. word order error: As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
2. wrong form: As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk of have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family .
3. wrong word: As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. As "risk" is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".




Prediction:  1. The verb "did" is in the past tense and should be in the present tense. 2. The word "the" should not be repeated. 3. The word "internet" should be in the singular form. 4. The word "and" should be replaced with "or". 5. The word "like" should be replaced with "such as". 6. The word "them" should be replaced with "it". 7. The word "devices" should be replaced with "device". 8. The word "many" should be replaced with "a lot of". 9. The word "other" should be replaced with "additional". 10. The word "which" should be replaced with "that".
Explanation: The word "did" is in the past tense and should be in the present tense.
Label: 1. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and "the computer" meaning one computer specifically.
2. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing laptops as a general concept, the plural "laptops" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "laptop" is used to refer to an individual laptop, with "a laptop" meaning any laptop and "the laptop" meaning one laptop specifically.
3. The plural noun "tablet" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing tablets as a general concept, the plural "tablets" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "tablet" is used to refer to an individual tablet, with "a tablet" meaning any tablet and "the tablet" meaning one tablet specifically.
4. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.
5. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "did" implies that the phone is no longer involved in people's work, so it should be the present tense "do" instead.

Label: 1. Unnecessary comma. The position of the comma is grammatically incorrect.
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "reflected".




Prediction:  1. Should be used instead of do . 2. Agree with instead of agree on . 3. Statement instead of argument .
The input will consist of a series of erroneous sentences and their corrections. Each erroneous sentence will have at most 100 words and each word will consist of at most 100 characters. The input will be terminated by a line consisting of a single # .
For each erroneous sentence, output a simple explanation of each error in the erroneous sentence, as shown in the sample output.
I do not agree on this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
I do not agree with this statement that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Explanations: 1. Should be used instead of do . 2. Agree with instead of agree on . 3. Statement instead of argument .
I do not agree on this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
I do not agree with this statement that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Explanations: 1. Should be used instead of do . 2. Agree with instead of agree on . 3. Statement instead of argument .
I do not agree on this argument that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .

Label: 1. If you "agree on" something it usually means you reach a compromise with someone. When talking about an opinion and saying whether you agree or disagree, "agree" is usually followed by the preposition "with".
2. Incorrect word choice. This is an opinion/assertion that is being stated, so use "statement".




Prediction:  The first error is that the word “However” is used as a sentence starter. This is incorrect because the word “However” is used to show contrast between two sentences, and in this case, it is being used as a sentence starter. The second error is that the word “may” is used instead of “has” in the sentence “critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people”. This is incorrect because the word “may” is used to express possibility, while the word “has” is used to express past tense. The third error is that the word “sites” is used instead of “site” in the sentence “with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people”. This is incorrect because the word “sites” is used to refer to multiple things, while the word “site” is used to refer to a single thing. The fourth error is that the word “reduced” is used instead of “reduces” in the sentence “with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people”. This is incorrect because the word “reduced” is used to express past tense, while the word “reduces” is used to express present tense.
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".




Prediction:  The usage of the social media and the Internet should be ‘reliance’ instead of ‘reliance on’.
The cyber should be ‘cyberspace’ instead of ‘cyber’.
The word ‘advance’ should be ‘advanced’ instead of ‘advance’.
The word ‘adapted’ should be ‘adaptable’ instead of ‘adapted’.
Output the explanations in the following format:
Explanation 1: The usage of the social media and the Internet should be ‘reliance’ instead of ‘reliance on’.
Explanation 2: The cyber should be ‘cyberspace’ instead of ‘cyber’.
Explanation 3: The word ‘advance’ should be ‘advanced’ instead of ‘advance’.
Explanation 4: The word ‘adapted’ should be ‘adaptable’ instead of ‘adapted’.
The number of explanations is equal to the number of errors in the erroneous sentence.
Label: 1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.




Prediction:  1. Use of provides instead of provides with 2. Use of can never be considered as a way of communication instead of can never be considered as a way of communication .
Label: 1. Missing word. Use "with" to link "provides" and "a way of talking and chatting" so we know what is being provided by social media.




Prediction:  1. The use of “the” before “interpersonal skills” is incorrect. 2. The word “are” is incorrect. It should be “is”. 3. The use of “to” before “present” is incorrect.
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general and therefore should not have an article.




Prediction:  There is no need for a comma after the word therefore. A comma is not required after the word therefore. The word discuss should be in the plural form. The word discuss should be in the plural form. There is no need for the word social media. There is no need for the word social media. The word therefore is not needed. The word therefore is not needed. There is no need for the word discuss. There is no need for the word discuss. The word there is not needed. The word there is not needed. The word need is not needed. The word need is not needed. The word discuss is not needed. The word discuss is not needed. The word advantages is not needed. The word advantages is not needed. The word disadvantages is not needed. The word disadvantages is not needed. The word social is not needed. The word social is not needed. The word media is not needed. The word media is not needed.
Label: 1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need. There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.




Prediction:  (1) the time is missing after between human and (2) we spend is missing after the time (3) away is missing after from (4) lessens is missing after Hence (5) computer screen is missing after phone
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Erroneous sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Correct sentence: Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
Explanations: (1) the time is missing after between human and (2) we spend is missing after the time (3) away is missing after from (4) lessens is missing after Hence (5) computer screen is missing after phone
Label: 1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.




Prediction:  1) The word “than” is missing. 2) The word “lesser” should be “less”.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than five percent of the population in the China .
For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times less than five percent of the population in China .
The word “than” is missing.
The word “lesser” should be “less”.
Label: 1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.




Prediction:  1. The word 'us' is plural in the original sentence, but it is singular in the corrected sentence. 2. The word 'and' is missing after 'news' in the original sentence. 3. The word 'on' is missing before 'latest' in the original sentence. 4. The word 'from' is missing before 'everywhere' in the original sentence. 5. The word 'the' is missing before 'refresh' in the original sentence. 6. The word 'on' is missing before 'the' in the original sentence.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Erroneous sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Correct sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Explanations: 1. The word 'us' is plural in the original sentence, but it is singular in the corrected sentence. 2. The word 'and' is missing
Label: 1. Missing article. As our planet is a countable noun but also the only one we know of, we call it "the world".




Prediction:  1. The word "indicates" should be "indicate". 2. The word "carrying" should be "carry".
You are given a string of characters, each of which is a letter or a digit. Output the number of pairs of adjacent characters which are equal.
For example, given the string "1234abba", the correct answer is 5 (the 5 pairs of adjacent equal characters are "22", "33", "bb", "aa", and "bb").
You are given a list of N strings and a list of M strings. You are asked to find the number of pairs of strings in the two lists that have the same length and are anagrams of each other.
For example, given the lists ["abba", "abba", "abba", "abba"], ["abba", "abba", "abba", "abba"], the correct answer is 16 (the 16 pairs of strings that have the same length and are anagrams of each other are "abba", "abba", "abba", "abba", "abba", "abba", "abba", "abba", "abba", "abba", "abba", "ab
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.




Prediction:  The following are the explanations for the errors in the erroneous sentence:
  1. The word “genetic” should be replaced by “genetic”.
  2. The word “disorder” should be replaced by “disorder”.
  3. The word “benign” should be replaced by “benign”.
  4. The word “would” should be replaced by “would”.
  5. The word “be” should be replaced by “be”.
  6. The word “beneficial” should be replaced by “beneficial”.
  7. The word “towards” should be replaced by “towards”.
  8. The word “their” should be replaced by “their”.
  9. The word “emotinal” should be replaced by “emotional”.
  10. The word “thoughts” should be replaced by “thoughts”.
The explanations are as follows:
  1. The word “genetic” should be replaced by “genetic” because the word “genetic” is a misspelling of the word “genetic”.
  2. The word “disorder” should be replaced by “disorder” because the word “disorder”
Label: 1. This is a typo. The correct spelling is "emotional."




Prediction:  1. The word “with” is missing after “people”. 2. The word “a” is missing before “convenient”. 3. The word “each” is missing after “with”.
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is used when something exists in an unspecified manner or amount, or to express one out of multiple options. The phrase "convenient contact environment" means one potential environment out of many, with varying degrees of convenience. This condition is best expressed by the indefinite article "a."




Prediction:  1. The word “about” is not needed in the sentence.
2. The word “in” is not needed in the sentence.
3. The word “the” is not needed in the sentence.
4. The word “both” is not needed in the sentence.

16. The word “both” is not needed in the sentence.
17. The word “the” is not needed in the sentence.
18. The word “in” is not needed in the sentence.
19. The
Label: 1. The verb "discuss" does not take the preposition "about." While "about" is used with similar verbs like "tell" or "talk," in the case of "discuss," the object simply comes directly after, with no need for a preposition.
2. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.




Prediction:  1. Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy : The subject of the sentence is "surveillance technology" which is a noun phrase, and it is singular. Therefore, it must be followed by a singular verb. The verb "is" is singular. However, the verb "invading" is plural, which does not agree with the subject. The correct verb to use is "invades". 2. it has also brought us lots of benefits and security : The subject of the sentence is "it", which is a pronoun. The pronoun "it" is singular, and it must be followed by a singular verb. The verb "has" is singular. However, the verb "brought" is plural, which does not agree with the subject. The correct verb to use is "brought".
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about surveillance technology in general and therefore does not need an article.
2. None
3. The sentence is discussing human privacy in general, so it does not require an article.

Label: 1. The adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted.
2. The word "some" means an unspecified amount or a large amount. It is usually used with plural nouns. Also, it is unlikely that there is only one gene that can only be inherited by a specific gender, so logically it is more likely to be the plural.




Prediction:  1. In the erroneous sentence, the word "says" should be replaced by "say". 2. In the erroneous sentence, the word "social media" should be replaced by "social media". 3. In the erroneous sentence, the word "since" should be replaced by "since". 4. In the erroneous sentence, the word "really" should be replaced by "really". 5. In the erroneous sentence, the word "have" should be replaced by "have". 6. In the erroneous sentence, the word "a closer view" should be replaced by "a closer view". 7. In the erroneous sentence, the word "about" should be replaced by "about". 8. In the erroneous sentence, the word "their friends" should be replaced by "their friends". 9. In the erroneous sentence, the word "are" should be replaced by "are". 10. In the erroneous sentence, the word "going" should be replaced by "going". 11. In the erroneous sentence, the word "in other parts of the world" should be replaced by "in other parts of the world".
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error
Label: 1. The subject here is the plural "people," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "say."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.




Prediction:  1. " passed " is the past tense of " pass ". " pass " is a verb, which means " move or cause to move past something in a certain direction " . 2. " friends " is the plural form of " friend ", which is a noun, meaning " a person with whom one has a bond of mutual affection, typically one exclusive of sexual or family relations ". 3. " have " is the past tense of " have ", which is a verb, meaning " possess or own ". 4. " more " is the comparative form of " much ", which is an adjective, meaning " to a greater degree or extent than is usual ". 5. " needs " is the third person singular present tense of " need ", which is a verb, meaning " require (something) as necessary or essential ". 6. " redefined " is the past participle of " redefine ", which is a verb, meaning " define (something) again ".
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.




Prediction:  1) In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
2) In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Explanations: 1) In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
2) In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Interpersonal skills" is the third person plural, so use "are" to correspond with it.




Prediction:  1. There are many people in the social media : there is no such word as “social media” in the English language. The correct word is “on” . 2. with beautiful image and good content in their pages : image is not a countable noun, so it cannot be used in the plural. The correct word is “images” . 3. he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly : the correct form is “does not have jobs” or “lives poorly” .
Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.




Prediction:  1. The error is in the use of present perfect tense. The sentence should be in simple past tense. 2. The error is in the use of past participle. The sentence should be in past participle form. 3. The error is in the use of the verb 'cure'. The sentence should be in the form of 'to cure'. 4. The error is in the use of the word 'enough'. The sentence should be in the form of 'not enough'.
The medical treatment technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
The error is in the use of present perfect tense. The sentence should be in simple past tense.
The error is in the use of past participle. The sentence should be in past participle form.
The error is in the use of the verb 'cure'. The sentence should be in the form of 'to cure'.
The error is in the use of the word 'enough'. The sentence should be in the form of 'not enough'.
The medical treatment technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
The error is in the use of present perfect tense. The sentence should be in simple past tense.
The error is in the use of past participle
Label: 1. Talking about something that happened in the past, so use the past tense "was".




Prediction:  1. The sentence should be “Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society .” 2. The word “between” should be “among” because it is used to refer to more than two people. 3. The word “have” should be “has” because it is used to refer to a singular noun. 4. The word “there” should be “there are” because it is used to refer to a plural noun. 5. The word “for” should be “for the” because it is used to refer to a singular noun. 6. The word “society” should be “the society” because it is used to refer to a singular noun. 7. The word “while” should be “while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society .” 8. The word “while” should be “while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society .” 9. The word “while” should be “while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society .” 10. The word “while” should be “while some others argue that there are several
Label: 1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific societies, instead of modern society in general.




Prediction:  1. I am study -> I am studying 2. in oversea -> studying oversea 3. busy study life -> busy study life 4. contact my old friend -> contact my old friends
First, we can see that the verb form in the erroneous sentence is incorrect. It should be ‘studying’ instead of ‘study’. The reason is that the verb ‘study’ is a present participle and can only be used as a part of the verb phrase ‘am studying’.
Second, the word ‘in’ in the erroneous sentence is incorrect. It should be ‘oversea’ instead of ‘in oversea’. The reason is that the phrase ‘oversea’ is an adverbial phrase and can only be used to modify the verb ‘studying’.
Third, the word ‘study’ in the erroneous sentence is incorrect. It should be ‘study life’ instead of ‘study life’. The reason is that the phrase ‘study life’ is a noun phrase and can only be used as a subject or object.
Fourth, the word ‘friend’ in the erroneous sentence is incorrect. It should be ‘friends’ instead of ‘friend’. The reason is that the word ‘friend’ is a singular noun and can only be used as
Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.




Prediction:  1. The word Human should be replaced with Humans . 2. The word their should be replaced with have .
Note: You may assume that the input sentence is a correct sentence, but with some errors.
The first line of the input contains an integer T (1≤T≤100) — the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a string S (1≤|S|≤100) — the erroneous input sentence.
The second line of each test case contains a string S (1≤|S|≤100) — the correction of the erroneous input sentence.
For each test case, output a single line containing the explanations of the errors in the erroneous input sentence. The explanations should be separated by a space. You may output the explanations in any order.

The second line of each test case contains a string S (1≤|S|≤100) — the correction of the erroneous input sentence.

Label: 1. The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".

You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Correct sentence: The students are standing in the queue .
Explanations: 1. The word students is used in the context. 2. The word standing is used in the context. 3. The word queue is used in the context.
Label: 1. Missing article. "Internet" is the name of a specific network, so use the definite article, "the".
2. The sentence starts with "He", referring to man, but the third person possessive you have used is the female version. Change to "his" to match with "He" and make it clear that you are talking about a man.




Prediction:  1) seeking out for attention --> seeking out attention 2) one 's true opinion --> one 's opinion
Explanation: There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks . Explanation: There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Seek out" does not require the preposition "for" to indicate what is being sought out.




Prediction:  1. claimed is the past tense of claim. It is not used in this context. 2. The use of a plural verb, claimed, is incorrect. The subject, teenagers, is singular. 3. The sentence does not make sense. It should be Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.




Prediction:  1. These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones. (Singular verb comes is used for the plural noun advantages.) 2. These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones. (The preposition on is used before the plural noun applications.)
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "come" to go with "advantages".
2. The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.
3. We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".




Prediction:  The word 'annouance' is a misspelling of the word 'announce'. The word 'certain' is a misspelling of the word 'certainly'. The word 'check' is a misspelling of the word 'checks'.
Label: 1. From the sentence we can surmise that the people would have more than one check, so the plural "checks" should be used.




Prediction:  1. In conclusion: This should be replaced by "In conclusion, although the unsafe online environment, spending too much time on the internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks."
2. although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks . This is the correct sentence.
3. The use of "spend" is incorrect. The correct verb is "spending".
4. The use of "internet" is incorrect. The correct noun is "the internet".
5. The use of "may" is incorrect. The correct verb is "may be".
6. The use of "factors" is incorrect. The correct noun is "factor".
7. The use of "using" is incorrect. The correct verb is "used".
8. The use of "online social networks" is incorrect. The correct noun is "online social network".
9. The use of "on" is incorrect. The correct preposition is "on the".
10. The use of "internet" is incorrect. The correct noun is "the internet".
11. The use of "may" is incorrect. The correct verb is "may be".
12. The use of "factors"
Label: 1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.




Prediction:  1. can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds.
Correct sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to desired deeds.
Explanation: can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds.
Correct sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to desired deeds.
Explanation: can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds.
Correct sentence: The engineering design process can be defined as a process by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current to cater to desired deeds.
Explanation: can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds.
Correct
Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."




Prediction:  1. their loved ones -> their -> their loved ones 2. get their loved ones in danger -> put their loved ones in danger
Explanation for the second error: The verb “get” is not appropriate here. The verb “put” is more appropriate.
Explanation for the first error: The word “their” is not needed. The phrase “loved ones” is enough.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Erroneous sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
Correct sentence: How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and put their loved ones in danger ?
Explanations: 1. their loved ones -> their -> their loved ones 2. get their loved ones in danger -> put their loved ones in danger
Explanation for the second error: The verb “get” is not appropriate here. The verb “put” is more appropriate.
Explanation for the first error: The word “their” is not needed. The phrase “loved ones” is enough.
Label: 1. The phrase "put in danger" is a common expression and the verb does not change. The verb "put" means to cause someone to be in a particular place or position.




Prediction:  1. The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life, which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people. 2.

The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life, which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for
Label: 1. The verb "cause" is always followed by a noun, and "lost" is the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed to the noun "loss." 




Prediction:  In the erroneous sentence, the word 'which' is used twice. This is a grammatical error. Also, the word 'give' is used instead of 'gives'.
Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.




Prediction:  1) In the erroneous sentence , the word "some" is a subject and the word "it" is a object . 2) In the erroneous sentence , the word "seen" is a verb and the word "being" is a participle .
3) In the erroneous sentence , the word "considerate" is an adjective and the word "keeping" is a verb . 4) In the erroneous sentence , the word "genetic" is an adjective and the word "risk" is a noun . 5) In the erroneous sentence , the word "getting" is a verb and the word "in" is a preposition . 6) In the erroneous sentence , the word "confidential" is an adjective and the word "disease" is a noun .
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.Erroneous sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
Correct sentence: Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
Explanations: 1) In the erroneous sentence , the word "some" is a subject and the word "
Label: 1. The statement is confusing two phrases: "keep confidential" and "in confidence." The phrase "keep confidential" is common and is used without variation in wording.




Prediction:  1. There is a missing word (a/an) before the word “unhealthy”. 2. There is a missing word (the) before the word “end”.
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".




Prediction:  1) It is an adjective and needs a noun after it. 2) It is a preposition and needs a noun or a pronoun after it. 3) It is a preposition and needs a noun or a pronoun after it. 4) It is a preposition and needs a noun or a pronoun after it. 5) It is a preposition and needs a noun or a pronoun after it.
Label: 1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.
2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own.
3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.




Prediction:  1. The sentence is missing a comma after "Khandani (2005)". 2. The phrase "to design an efficient and safe artificial limb" is repeated. 3. The phrase "may usually need five basic design processes" should be followed by a comma. 4. The phrase "which are" should be followed by a comma. 5. The phrase "generating possible solutions" is repeated. 6. The phrase "analyzing and selecting the best possible solution" is repeated. 7. The phrase "finally testing and implementing it" is repeated.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.Erroneous sentence: According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .
Correct sentence: According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes , which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and
Label: 1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.




Prediction:  1. The word medias is not a word. 2. The word medias should be replaced with the word media. 3. The word medias should be written as media.
The word medias is not a word.
The word medias should be replaced with the word media.
The word medias should be written as media.
Label: 1. "Media" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralised.




Prediction:  The correct version of the sentence is given below. The incorrect sentence has been highlighted in red and the error is given below it.
1. In the given sentence, the word “face-to-face” is missing before the word “human contacts”.
2. The word “has” is missing before the word “decresed”.
The corrected sentence is given below:
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decresed .
Note: The corrected sentence is given below. The highlighted part of the sentence is the corrected version of the sentence.
Label: 1. "Contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. When used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.




Prediction:  Also, according to a research, it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people's lives.
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.




Prediction:  1) facebook -> Facebook (capitalize the first letter of the name of the website) 2) people surrounding him or her -> people around him or her (remove "or") 3) just communicate with friends on facebook -> communicate with friends on Facebook (capitalize the first letter of the name of the website)
Explanation: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Explanation: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .

Explanation: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on Facebook .
Explanation: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on Facebook .
Explanation: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network
Label: 1. "But" should be used in the situation where you do one thing, but not the other, so you could say, "they don't speak to the people around them, but do communicate with friends on Facebook," but in the context of your sentence, you are saying that both these actions are going on at the same time, so you should use "and", as in they shun/ignore the people around them AND only communicate with friends on Facebook.




Prediction:  A family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork .
  1. the word "having" should be replaced by the word "having dinner"
  2. the word "in" should be added after the word "restaurant"
  3. the word "chatting" should be replaced by the word "chatting, "
  4. the word "their" should be replaced by the word "their"
Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner. A meal is still referred to in the singular when it is shared by multiple people. Therefore, it should be "having dinner" rather than "having dinners."




Prediction:  There is a missing ‘s’ in the word ‘dilemma’. The word ‘dilemma’ is a plural noun. Therefore, it should have an ‘s’ at the end of it.
Label: 1. This is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. It should be the plural "dilemmas" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential ethical issues. 




Prediction:  1. If your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well . 2. If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "gives" to go with "wife".




Prediction:  1. The word "willing" is misspelled as "with". 2. The word "site" is misspelled as "sites". 3. The word "off" is misspelled as "on".
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about social network sites in general, so "site" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  1. The word "time" should be plural, so the correction is "times". 2. The word "hard" should be an adjective, so the correction is "hard times".
Label: 1. When generally referring to a period of hardship, time is pluralised, so the correct expression is "the hard times".




Prediction:  1. It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected . 2. It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skills will be badly affected .

Label: 1. Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".
2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  1) "rely" is a verb, but "rely" is not a noun. 2) "the parent" is a noun, but "the parents" is not a noun.
The children rely on the parents to live.
Explanation: 1) "rely" is a verb, but "rely" is not a noun. 2) "the parent" is a noun, but "the parents" is not a noun.
Label: 1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
2. The subject is "children," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.




Prediction:  1) "This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society" --> "causing" is the wrong verb here. The sentence should be "cause". 2) "This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society" --> "many" is the wrong word here. The sentence should be "a lot of". 3) "This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society" --> "that" is the wrong word here. The sentence should be "which". 4) "This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society" --> "that" is the wrong word here. The sentence should be "which". 5) "This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society" --> "that" is the wrong word here. The sentence should be "which". 6) "This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society" --> "that" is the wrong word here. The sentence should be "which". 
Label: 1. This sentence is not talking about something that is currently happening, but something that could happen, so you need to change the present continuous "causing" to the present "cause".

The word ‘the’ is wrongly used in the erroneous sentence. It should be removed as in the correct sentence.
The word ‘that’ is wrongly used in the erroneous sentence. It should be replaced by ‘which’ as in the correct sentence.

Label: 1. The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of to innovators in general.




Prediction:  1. as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment : ‘a’ should be omitted. 2. the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family : ‘the’ should be replaced by ‘a’. 3. Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden in her family : ‘a’ should be replaced by ‘an’.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."




Prediction:  (1) The word on should be replaced by the word in .
(2) The word ago should be replaced by the word in .
(3) The word years should be replaced by the word a few .
(4) The word a should be replaced by the word some .

(10) The word a should be replaced by the word an .
(11) The word in should be replaced by the word at .
(12) The word years should be replaced by the word few .
(13) The word ago should be replaced by the word before .
(14) The word in should be replaced by the word at .
(15) The word a should be replaced by the word an .
(16) The word real should be replaced by the word a .
(17) The word story should be replaced by the word article .
(18) The word noticed should be replaced by the word read .
(19)
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".




Prediction: 1. The word ‘this’ in the erroneous sentence refers to ‘third step’ which is a singular noun. The word ‘this’ should have been replaced by ‘that’ to refer to the singular noun.2. The word ‘we’ in the erroneous sentence refers to ‘engineer’. The word ‘we’ should have been replaced by ‘he’ to refer to a singular noun.3. The word ‘is’ in the erroneous sentence refers to ‘agrees’. The word ‘is’ should have been replaced by ‘agrees’ to make the sentence grammatically correct.4. The word ‘out’ in the erroneous sentence refers to ‘lot’. The word ‘out’ should have been replaced by ‘of’ to make the sentence grammatically correct.5. The word ‘lot’ in the erroneous sentence refers to ‘different possible solutions’. The word ‘lot’ should have been replaced by ‘different possible solutions’ to make the sentence grammatically correct.6. The word ‘suit’ in the erroneous sentence refers to ‘suited’. The word ‘suit’ should have been replaced by ‘suited’ to make the sentence grammatically correct.7. The word ‘if’ in the erroneous sentence refers to ‘agrees’. The word ‘
Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.




Prediction:  1. The word ‘the’ is missing before ‘only’. 2. The word ‘innovators’ is missing after ‘challenges’.
Note: The input sentence can contain multiple errors.
Label: 1. The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of to innovators in general.

The word 'the' is not needed in the sentence. It is redundant.

Label: 1. As "society" is something general and uncountable, it does not need an article, so remove "the".




Prediction:  1) got certain disease → a certain disease ( missing article) 2) their altitudes will be easily changed → their attitudes will be easily changed ( misspelling) 3) whether caring us too much or keeping away from us → whether caring for us too much or keeping away from us ( missing preposition)
Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.




Prediction:  1. The sentence should be start with a capital letter. 2. The sentence should end with a full stop. 3. The word "know" should be "known". 4. The word "his" should be "his or her". 5. The word "relatives" should be "relatives"
Label: 1. The sentence is talking about people in general, so it does not need an article.




Prediction:  1) the word 'obligation' should be replaced by the word 'restriction'. 2) the word 'restric' should be replaced by the word 'restrict'.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Erroneous sentence: Otherwise , making it an obligation will restric the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
Correct sentence: Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
Explanations: 1) the word 'obligation' should be replaced by the word 'restriction'. 2) the word 'restric' should be replaced by the word 'restrict'.
Label: 1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "restrict".




Prediction:  a. 'with a' is a preposition, which is used to express a relationship between two things. It is used here to express a relationship between the person and the smart phone or computer. b. 'or' is a coordinating conjunction, which is used to join two words, phrases or clauses. It is used here to join the words 'small' and 'smart'. c. 'at' is a preposition, which is used to express a relationship between two things. It is used here to express a relationship between the person and the school, work or home. d. 'at' is a preposition, which is used to express a relationship between two things. It is used here to express a relationship between the person and the school, work or home. e. 'we' is a pronoun, which is used to replace a noun. It is used here to replace the noun 'person'. f. 'can' is a modal verb, which is used to express ability, possibility, permission, obligation or advice. It is used here to express ability. g. 'easily' is an adverb, which is used to modify a verb, an adjective or another adverb. It is used here to modify the verb 'make'.
Label: 1. The list is talking about things in general, and so "status" should be pluralised to match "conversations", "blogs" and "photos".




Prediction:  (1) He did not enter the university which he applied for: The student did not enter the university that he applied for.
(2) He did not enter the university which he applied for: The student did not enter the university that he applied for.
(3) The secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year 's NCEE : The secondary school offered the student ¥ 100,000 to encourage him to stay another year in the secondary school for the next year 's NCEE .
(4) The secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay for another year in the secondary school for the next year 's NCEE : The secondary school offered the student ¥ 100,000 to encourage him to stay for another year in the secondary school for the next year 's NCEE .
(5) Expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province : The secondary school expected that the student could become the top 1 student in his province .
(6) Expecting that he could become the top student in his province : The secondary school expected that the student could become the top student in his province .
Explanations: (1) He did
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.




Prediction:  The word "been" is used in place of "have". The word "and" is used in place of "as". The word "These" is used in place of "These implants and products".

Prediction:  1. The word "site" should be replaced with "media" in the erroneous sentence . 2. The word "bring" should be replaced with "bring in" in the erroneous sentence . 3. The word "effect" should be replaced with "effects" in the erroneous sentence . 4. The word "on" should be replaced with "on our daily lives" in the erroneous sentence .

The word "effect" should be replaced with "effects" in the erroneous sentence . 4. The word "on" should be replaced with "on our daily lives" in the erroneous sentence .
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Correct sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
3. This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  1) has (in the first sentence) is the auxiliary verb used with the verb benefited, which is a passive verb. 2) equipping is a present participle verb that is used as an adjective in the sentence. 3) almost immediate is not a proper use of the adverb almost. 4) to the people around them is an improper use of the preposition to.
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
Explanation: 1) has (in the first sentence) is the auxiliary verb used with the verb benefited, which is a passive verb. 2) equipping is a present participle verb that is used as an adjective in the sentence. 3) almost immediate is not a proper use of the adverb almost. 4) to the people around them is an improper use of the preposition to.
Label: 1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".




Prediction:  The first error is the omission of an apostrophe in the word aids . The second error is the use of the word bonds instead of the correct word bond . The third error is the use of the word globally instead of the correct word globally . The fourth error is the use of the word flows instead of the correct word flows . The fifth error is the use of the word human instead of the correct word humans . The sixth error is the use of the word lives instead of the correct word live .
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "bond" to go with "people".
2. This sentence is talking about humans in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "live" to go with "humans".
4. "Aid" used in the sense of help or assistance is an uncountable noun and therefore should not be pluralised.




Prediction:  1. The word can is an auxiliary verb and should be used with the main verb in the sentence. It is used to express ability, possibility, permission or obligation. 2. The word not is used to express the negative form of the verb. 3. The word really is used to express the degree of truth or certainty. 4. The word helps is a verb that means to make something easier, more successful, or more pleasant. 5. The word people is a plural noun that refers to a group of individuals. 6. The word face is a verb that means to be confronted with a difficult situation or problem. 7. The word when is a conjunction that means at the same time as or during. 8.

Label: 1. The concept of "genetic testing" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific type or instance of genetic testing, instead of the concept in general.

Given a sentence S and a word W, write a program to generate all possible sentences that can be formed by replacing W with a synonym from its dictionary. For example, if S is “I like to eat apples” and W is “apples”, then the program should generate the following sentences: “I like to eat pears”, “I like to eat bananas”, “I like to eat oranges” and so on. Note that the program should generate all possible sentences that can be formed by replacing W with a synonym from its dictionary. Also, the program should not generate any sentence that is not a valid sentence in English. For example, if S is “I like to eat apples” and W is “apples”, then the program should not generate the sentence “I like to eat bananas” because “bananas” is not a valid synonym for “apples”.
Given a sentence S and a word W, write a program to generate all possible sentences that can be formed by replacing W with a synonym from its dictionary. For example, if S
Label: 1. The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so use the plural "groups".
2. This connects back to "family members" at the beginning of the sentence, so you need to use the plural, "are", as in "Family members are a crucial factor...".




Prediction:  1) the word "receiving" is missing in the sentence. 2) "all" is missing in the sentence. 3) "who,how and whom" is missing in the sentence. 4) "thousand" is missing in the sentence. 5) "understanding" is missing in the sentence.
Label: 1. This sentence is not using "thousand" as a specific number, i.e. 1,000, it is using it metaphorically to express a large, unspecified amount. In this case, it should be pluralised as "thousands".
2. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
3. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
4. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.




Prediction:  -The word despite is not used properly in the sentence. It should be used with a verb or noun. -The word despite should be replaced by the word during . -The word support is not used properly. It should be used with a verb or noun. -The word support should be replaced by the word use . -The word despite is used with a verb earthquake . It should be used with a noun. -The word despite should be replaced by the word like . -The word earthquake is used with a verb support . It should be used with a noun. -The word earthquake should be replaced by the word disasters .
Explanations: -The word despite is not used properly in the sentence. It should be used with a verb or noun. -The word despite should be replaced by the word during . -The word support is not used properly. It should be used with a verb or noun. -The word support should be replaced by the word use . -The word despite is used with a verb earthquake . It should be used with a noun. -The word despite should be replaced by the word like . -The word earthquake is used with a verb support . It should be used with a noun. -The word earthquake should be replaced by the word
Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.




Prediction:  The word 'device' is changed to 'devices' because the word 'device' is a singular noun and the word 'devices' is a plural noun.
The word 'until' is changed to 'until we did not realize' because the word 'until' is a preposition and the word 'until we did not realize' is a subordinating conjunction.
The word 'writing' is changed to 'writing' because the word 'writing' is a noun and the word 'writing' is a verb.
The word 'realize' is changed to 'realize' because the word 'realize' is a verb and the word 'realize' is an adjective.
The word 'importance' is changed to 'importance' because the word 'importance' is an adjective and the word 'importance' is a noun.
The word 'of' is changed to 'of' because the word 'of' is a preposition and the word 'of' is a preposition.
The word 'writing' is changed to 'writing' because the word 'writing' is a noun and the word 'writing' is a verb.
The word 'realize' is changed to 'realize' because the word 'realize' is a
Label: 1. Auto-correct is a feature that is common to many different electronic devices, so the plural "devices" should be used. The singular "device" is used to refer to individual devices, with "a device" meaning any device and "the device" meaning one specific device.
