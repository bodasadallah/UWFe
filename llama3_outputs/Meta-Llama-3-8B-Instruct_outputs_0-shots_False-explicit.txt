Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle.

Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Prediction: 1. The word "that" is missing in the erroneous sentence. The word "that" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces a dependent clause. The dependent clause is a noun phrase that functions as the object of the preposition "of". The dependent clause is missing in the erroneous sentence, which makes the sentence ungrammatical.
2. The word "loss" is misspelled as "loss". The word "loss" is a verb that means "to fail to keep or maintain". The word "loss" is misspelled as "loss" in the erroneous sentence, which makes the sentence ungrammatical.
3. The word "interest" is misspelled as "interest". The word "interest" is a noun that means "a feeling of being interested in something". The word "interest" is misspelled as "interest" in the erroneous sentence, which makes the sentence ungrammatical.
4. The word "face-to-face" is misspelled as "face-to-face". The phrase "face-to-face" is an adverb that means "in person". The phrase "face-to-face" is misspelled as "face-to-face" in the erroneous sentence, which makes the sentence ungrammatical

Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.

Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.

cleaned: 
Label: 1. The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.




Prediction: 1. The word "researches" is plural, but the word "research" is singular. The word "research" is the correct form.
2. The word "face-to-face" is a compound adjective, but the word "face-to-face" is a compound noun. The word "face-to-face" is the correct form.
3. The word "meeting" is a noun, but the word "meet" is a verb. The word "meeting" is the correct form.
4. The word "frequency" is a noun, but the word "frequent" is an adjective. The word "frequency" is the correct form.
5. The word "people" is a plural noun, but the word "person" is a singular noun. The word "people" is the correct form.
6. The word "that" is a relative pronoun, but the word "which" is a relative pronoun. The word "that" is the correct form.
7. The word "addicted" is an adjective, but the word "addiction" is a noun. The word "addicted" is the correct form.

cleaned: 1. The word "researches" is plural, but the word "research" is singular. The word "research" is the correct form.

6. The word "that" is a relative pronoun, but the word "which" is a relative pronoun. The word "that" is the correct form.
7. The word "addicted" is an adjective, but the word "addiction" is a noun. The word "addicted" is the correct form.
8. The word "sites" is a plural noun, but the word "site" is a singular noun
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Prediction: 1. The word "reason" is misspelled as "reason of halt". The correct form is "reason for halt".
2. The word "work" is misspelled as "work was". The correct form is "work".
3. The word "that" is misspelled as "that the higher level of authorities". The correct form is "that the higher level authorities".

4. The word "thought" is misspelled as "thought an underground traffic system". The correct form is "thought an underground traffic system was".
5. The word "necessary" is misspelled as "necessary for Harbin". The correct form is "necessary for Harbin".
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.

cleaned: 
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."

I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.

Explanations:
cleaned: 
Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.

cleaned: 
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.

Explanations:

Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."

cleaned: 
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here.

2. The singular noun "personality" means a collection of traits, behaviors, or emotional qualities that make up an individual's character. The plural noun "personalities" refers to the personalities of multiple people.

cleaned: 1. The word "the" is missing before "face-to-face human contacts".
2. The word "has" is missing before "decresed".
3. The word "contact" is missing after "face-to-face human".
Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.

Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.

Label: 1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."

Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".

cleaned: 
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".

Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.

Label: 1. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and "the computer" meaning one computer specifically.
2. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing laptops as a general concept, the plural "laptops" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "laptop" is used to refer to an individual laptop, with "a laptop" meaning any laptop and "the laptop" meaning one laptop specifically.
3. The plural noun "tablet" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing tablets as a general concept, the plural "tablets" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "tablet" is used to refer to an individual tablet, with "a tablet" meaning any tablet and "the tablet" meaning one tablet specifically.
4. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.
5. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "did" implies that the phone is no longer involved in people's work, so it should be the present tense "do" instead.

Label: 1. If you "agree on" something it usually means you reach a compromise with someone. When talking about an opinion and saying whether you agree or disagree, "agree" is usually followed by the preposition "with".

cleaned: 
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".

2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.

Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.

Label: 1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Interpersonal skills" is the third person plural, so use "are" to correspond with it.




Prediction: You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.Erroneous sentence: There are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages , however in real life , he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly .
Correct sentence: There are many people on social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages , however in real life , he or she may not have jobs or live poorly .
Explanations:
cleaned: 
Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.

Prediction: ## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.
The first line of each test case contains a string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100) — the erroneous sentence. The second line of each test case contains a string C (|C| = |S|) — the correct sentence.
It is guaranteed that the erroneous sentence and the correct sentence are different.

## Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence. The explanations should be separated by a single space. The explanations should be in the same order as the errors in the erroneous sentence. If there are no errors in the erroneous sentence, output a single line containing the word "OK".

## Sample Output

study -> studying
in -> oversea

cleaned: 
Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.

Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.

cleaned: 
Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."

Label: 1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.

Also , according to research , it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives .
Explanation: The word "research" is misspelled as "a research". The word "Facebook" is misspelled as "the Facebook". The word "users" is misspelled as "the users". The word "people" is misspelled as "other people 's".
cleaned: 
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.

This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.

Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

2. The word "in" is missing after "school".
3. The word "the" is missing before "top".
4. The word "student" is missing after "top".
5. The word "in" is missing after "province".
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.

Label: 1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".




Prediction: ## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an erroneous sentence. The second line contains the correct sentence. The length of each sentence is at most 1000 characters. The erroneous sentence is a correct sentence with at most 5 errors. The errors are: 1. A word is misspelled. 2. A word is missing. 3. A word is repeated. 4. A word is used in the wrong form (e.g. plural instead of singular). 5. A word is used in the wrong order. The erroneous sentence and the correct sentence are in the same language. The words in the sentences are separated by a single space. The words in the sentences are in lowercase letters. The words in the sentences do not contain any punctuation marks.

## Output

For each test case, output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence. The explanations should be in the same order as the errors in the erroneous sentence. If there is no error in the erroneous sentence, output “No errors”.

cleaned: 
Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.
