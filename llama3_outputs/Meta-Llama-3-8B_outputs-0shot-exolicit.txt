Prediction:  
1. The word "qualified" is not appropriate here, and should be replaced with "creative".
2. The word "resource" is not appropriate here, and should be replaced with "resources".

Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle. 




Prediction:  The first error is a word choice error. The correct word is "hand", not "side". The second error is a verb tense error. The correct verb is "wants", not "want".
Explanation: The first error is a word choice error. The correct word is "hand", not "side". The second error is a verb tense error. The correct verb is "wants", not "want".
Explanation: The first error is a word choice error. The correct word is "hand", not "side". The second error is a verb tense error. The correct verb is "wants", not "want".
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Prediction:  
1. The word "disadvantage" is singular, while the word "concerns" is plural. In this sentence, the word "disadvantage" should be changed to "disadvantages".
2. The word "the" is redundant in this sentence. The word "that" is enough to introduce the clause.
3. The preposition "of" is not correct in this sentence. The preposition "in" is more appropriate in this sentence.
Sample Input:
One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct sentence: One of the disadvantages that many people concerns is that people loss interest in face-to-face communication .
Errors:
1. Error: disadvantage, Correction: disadvantages
2. Error: the, Correction:  
3. Error: of, Correction: in
Sample Output:
1. The word "disadvantage" is singular, while the word "concerns" is plural. In this sentence, the word "disadvantage" should be changed to "disadvantages".
2. The word "the" is redundant in this sentence. The word "that" is enough to introduce the clause.
3. The preposition "of" is not correct in
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.




Prediction:  shall is used to express a command, but in this case it is not a command. So, it should be replaced by should.
2. Error: not, Correction: be

3. Error: for, Correction: of
Explanations: for is used to express the purpose of an action, but in this case it is not the purpose of an action. So, it should be replaced by of.
4. Error: easy abuse, Correction: easy abuse

5. Error: distorted usage, Correction: distorted usage
Explanations: distorted usage is used to express the negative of a verb, but in this case it is not the negative of a verb. So, it should be replaced by distorted usage.
6. Error: shall, Correction: should
Explanations: shall is used to express a command, but in this case it is not a command. So
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 




Prediction:  The preposition with is used to talk about things that are with someone or something. In this sentence, the preposition with is used to talk about the things that are with a company. So, the preposition with should be replaced by the preposition for.
2. Error: cash, Correction: cash reimbursement
Explanations: The noun cash is used to talk about money that is in the form of coins or notes. In this sentence, the noun cash is used to talk about the money that is given as a reimbursement. So, the noun cash should be replaced by the phrase cash reimbursement.
3. Error: users, Correction: users'
Explanations: The noun users is used to talk about people who use something. In this sentence, the noun users is used to talk about the people who use the social media sites. So, the noun users should be replaced by the noun users'.
4. Error: leaks, Correction: leak
Explanations: The noun leaks is used to talk about something that is leaking. In this sentence, the noun leaks is used to talk about the action of leaking. So, the noun leaks should be replaced by the noun leak.
5. Error: information, Correction: information
Explanations: The noun
Label: 1. The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.




Prediction:  1. The error is in the subject. The subject should be singular. The correct subject is Research.
2. The error is in the verb. The verb should be singular. The correct verb is shows.
The above explanation is the output of the program for the given erroneous input sentence and its correction, followed by the explicit errors in this sentence.
Explanation of the program:
The program uses a dictionary to store the corrections for the errors in the erroneous sentence. The dictionary is created using the input correction and the explicit errors. The program then loops through the erroneous sentence and checks for each word in the sentence. If the word is present in the dictionary, the program replaces the word with the corresponding correction from the dictionary. If the word is not present in the dictionary, the program prints an error message. The program also checks for the presence of the word "that" in the sentence and replaces it with the correct word "which" if it is present. Finally, the program prints the corrected sentence along with the explanations for each error.
The program uses the "re" module to replace the word "that" with the correct word "which". The "re" module is used to perform regular expression matching in Python. The program uses the "re.sub" function to
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Prediction:  
1.  is an article, which is not required in the context. The article  is used to indicate a specific noun, and in this context, the noun  is already specific enough, so the article is not required.
2.  is an adjective, which is not required in the context. The adjective  is used to modify a noun, and in this context, the noun  is already modified by the adjective  , so the adjective  is not required.
3.  is a preposition, which is not required in the context. The preposition  is used to indicate a location or direction, and in this context, the location or direction is already indicated by the phrase  , so the preposition  is not required.
4.  is an adverb, which is not required in the context. The adverb  is used to modify a verb, and in this context, the verb  is already modified by the adverb  , so the adverb  is not required.

Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.

Label: 1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".

13. Error: device, Correction: device
Label: 1. The subject is "he/she," which is singular, so the verb should be singular for subject-verb agreement.




Prediction:  1. The word "the" was omitted before "children".
2. The word "parents" was used instead of "parent".

Label: 1. Missing word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. This sentence is either referring to the parents of specific children, or parents and children in general, but either way, "parents" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  a nutshell is a small box or container, not a large box or container.
2. Error: their, Correction: the
Explanations: their is the possessive form of the pronoun they, which refers to a group of people, not the possessive form of the pronoun they, which refers to a group of people.
3. Error: the, Correction: for

7. Error: their, Correction: their
Explanations: their is the possessive
Label: 1. "In a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. The phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but the specificity of "the" makes it sound literal. Instead of referring figuratively to something very simple, it would mean something that is literally inside a nutshell.




Prediction:  
1. about should be the, because we are talking about advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life.
2. life should be lives, because it is plural, and it refers to daily lives.

Label: 1. "Discuss" does not need to be followed by a preposition.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  connect is a verb and it needs to be conjugated in the present tense. It should be connects .
2. Error: people, Correction: people

The second line contains the correct sentence.
The third line contains the number of errors in the erroneous sentence.
The next lines contain the errors in the erroneous sentence.
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Prediction:  
1. The word "the" is missing in the sentence. 
2. The word "in" is missing in the sentence. 


Label: 1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. Missing word. The correct expression is "get in contact".




Prediction:  An add-on is a software program that extends or adds to the functionality of a primary application.
2. Error: personal profile, Correction: personal profiles
Explanations: A personal profile is a detailed description of an individual’s personal characteristics, interests, and experiences.

8. Error: other, Correction: other
Explanations: Other is
Label: 1. The sentence is discussing add-ons in general, so "add-on" should be pluralised.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.




Prediction:  The possessive form of the singular pronoun their is the . The possessive form of the plural pronoun their is theirs .
2. Error: right, Correction: to
Explanations: The preposition to is required after the verb have .
3. Error: healthiness, Correction: health
Explanations: The adjective healthy is used to describe a person or animal’s health. The noun health is used to describe the state of a person or animal’s health.
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".




Prediction:  I think you made a typo here, you meant to type "believe".
2. Error: entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still , Correction: entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still
Explanations: You probably forgot a period after "relatives".
3. Error: but he has no obligation to tell still , Correction: but he has no obligation to tell still
Explanations: You probably forgot a period after "relatives".
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "believe."




Prediction:  
1. "to make" is incorrect because it is a verb and should be replaced by a preposition "from". 
2. "for" is incorrect because it is a conjunction and should be replaced by a conjunction "and". 
3. "will" is incorrect because it is a modal verb and should be replaced by a modal verb "have". 

Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."




Prediction:  
1. The error is caused by the fact that the word "other" is not a plural form. The correct form is "others". 
2. The error is caused by the fact that the word "placed" is a verb, and the word "implanted" is a verb. The correct form is "place" and "implant". 
3. The error is caused by the fact that the word "to" is a preposition, and the word "in" is a preposition. The correct form is "in".

Label: 1. As "permission" is something granted by another person, this is already taken for granted without needing to explicitly say "other's". 
2. You should explicitly state "technology" for clarity.
3. An implant goes inside the body, so you need to use "in" accordingly.

4. Error: his or her, Correction: his or her
Explanations: The word his or her is a pronoun, so it must be used with a verb.
5. Error: family or relatives, Correction: family or relatives
Explanations: The word family or relatives is a compound noun, so it must be used with a verb.
Explanation: The word family is a noun, so it must be used with a verb.
Explanation: The word or is a conjunction, so it must be used with a noun.
Explanation: The word relatives is a noun, so it must be used with a verb.
Explanation: The word relatives is a noun, so it must be used with a verb.
Label: 1. You are expressing an opinion that you hold now, not something that you thought in the past, so you should use the present tense, "think".




Prediction:  You have to use the past participle of the verb transfer to form the past perfect tense.
2. Error: spying, Correction: spying on
Explanations: You have to add the preposition on to the noun spying to form the noun phrase spying on.
3. Error: advertising, Correction: advertising on

The input file contains a single test case. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), the number of words in the erroneous sentence. The second line contains n words, separated by spaces. The third line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 50), the number of words in the correct sentence. The fourth line contains m words, separated by spaces.
The first line contains an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 50), the number of errors in the erroneous sentence. The next k lines each contain two strings separated by a single space. The first string is the erroneous word and the second string is the correction.
For each error in the erroneous sentence, output a single line containing the error number, the erroneous word and the correction. The
Label: 1. This is the passive voice, continuing from the phrase "is recorded." The passive voice requires a form of the verb "to be" followed by a secondary verb, which is always the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "transfer" to the past participle "transferred."




Prediction:  1. Error: shwing, Correction: showing
Explanation: The word “shwing” is not a word. It should be “showing” instead.
2. Error: experience, Correction: experiences
Explanation: The word “experience” should be “experiences” because it is plural.
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."
2. The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.

Label: 1. "More" is never used with "easier" because "easier" already contains the sense of it being "more".




Prediction:  1. The article "the" is missing before the noun "internet" in the erroneous sentence.
2. Error: were, Correction: was
Explanations: 2. The verb "were" is in the plural form in the erroneous sentence, but the subject of the sentence is singular. Therefore, the singular verb "was" should be used.
3. Error: telephone, Correction: telephones
Explanations: 3. The noun "telephone" is in the singular form in the erroneous sentence, but the subject of the sentence is plural. Therefore, the plural noun "telephones" should be used.
4. Error: give, Correction: given
Explanations: 4. The verb "give" is in the simple present tense in the erroneous sentence, but the subject of the sentence is in the past tense. Therefore, the past participle "given" should be used.
5. Error: way, Correction: ways
Explanations: 5. The noun "way" is in the singular form in the erroneous sentence, but the subject of the sentence is plural. Therefore, the plural noun "ways" should be used.
6. Error: sites, Correction: site
Explanations: 6
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.




Prediction:  It is a singular noun and should be in singular form.
2. Error: essential, Correction: essential
Explanations: It is an adjective and should be in singular form.
3. Error: to overcome, Correction: to overcome
Explanations: It is a preposition and should be in singular form.

Explanations: It is a singular noun and should be in singular form.
2. Error: essential, Correction: essential
Explanations: It is an adjective and should be in singular form.
3. Error: to overcome, Correction: to overcome
Explanations: It is a preposition and should be in singular form.
4. Error: challenges, Correction: challenges
Explanations: It is a plural noun and should be in
Label: 1. The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.




Prediction:  
1. The error is the result of a missing space between this and happens.
2. The error is the result of a missing word between this and more.
3. The error is the result of a missing word between more and often.
4. The error is the result of a missing word between which and is.
5. The error is the result of a missing word between is and harder.

12. The error is the result of a missing word between child and has.
13. The error is the result of a missing word between been and brought.
14. The error is the result of a missing word between to and .

Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.




Prediction:  The plural form of challenge is challenges.
2. Error: for, Correction: for
Explanations: The preposition for is used with the verb ‘to challenge’.
Label: 1. The pronoun "another" means "one more," so it is singular and cannot be used with the plural "challenges." The singular "challenge" should be used instead.




Prediction:  1. The word issue should be plural because it is the subject of the verb have . 2. The verb has should be have in the present tense. 3. The preposition at should be in because it should be followed by a place.
Input format: The input contains two lines. The first line contains an erroneous sentence, and the second line contains the correct sentence. The erroneous sentence and the correct sentence contain only letters, digits, spaces, and punctuation marks. The erroneous sentence and the correct sentence are the same length.
Output format: Print the explanations for each error in the erroneous sentence, one per line.

Sample Input 1: In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
Sample Output 1: 1. The word issue should be plural because it is the subject of the verb have .
2. The verb has should be have in the present tense.
3. The preposition at should be in because it should be followed by a place.
Sample Input 2: I have been to a lot of places
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about privacy issues in general, so "issue" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Privacy issues" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
3. Incorrect word. The correct expression is "in the first place".




Prediction:  
1. The word "has" is used to describe something that belongs to someone. In the sentence, "has gene A" is not describing something that belongs to someone. The correct word to use here is "have".
2. The word "under" is used to describe something that is below or beneath something else. In the sentence, "under high risk" is not describing something that is below or beneath something else. The correct word to use here is "at".
3. The word "under" is used to describe something that is below or beneath something else. In the sentence, "under high risk" is not describing something that is below or beneath something else. The correct word to use here is "at".
4. The word "runing" is not a word. The correct word to use here is "running".
Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.




Prediction:  You may have typed the word "the" by mistake.

Label: 1. Missing article. As you are talking specifically about the next generation, use the definite article, "the".




Prediction:   
2. Error: social, Correction: social network  
Explanations:  
3. Error: creat, Correction: create  
Explanations:  
4. Error: the people, Correction: people  
Explanations:  

Label: 1. The concept of "people" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of people instead of to people in general.




Prediction:  1. The word "shall" is used to express a requirement or obligation, while "should" is used to express a suggestion or recommendation. The correction is made to reflect the intended meaning of the sentence.
2. The phrase "for the public" is used to indicate that something is available to the public, while "to the public" is used to indicate that something is available to a specific group of people. The correction is made to reflect the intended meaning of the sentence.
3. The word "and" is used to connect two or more things, while "or" is used to indicate a choice between two things. The correction is made to reflect the intended meaning of the sentence.
Explanation: The sentence is corrected to reflect the intended meaning and grammar.
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.




Prediction:  
1. In the sentence, the article 'the' is missing before the noun 'corporate world'. 
2. The word 'network' is singular. It should be 'networks' to match the plural form of the noun 'employees'.
3. The verb 'spend' is present participle form. It should be 'spending' to match the present participle form of the verb 'concentrating'.

Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."




Prediction:  
1. of is used to join two nouns or pronouns. It is not used to join a noun and a verb. 
2. in is used to indicate a place. It is not used to indicate the time spent. 
3. the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used in the social media sites 
4. the more the writing skills will be reduced when the more time used on the social media sites 
5. the more is used to indicate a quantity or degree. It is not used to indicate a person or thing. 
6. the more time used in the social media sites 
7. the more time used on the social media sites 
8. in is used to indicate a place. It is not used to indicate the time spent. 
9. the more time used in the social media sites 
10. the more time used on the social media sites 
11. in is used to indicate a place. It is not used to indicate the time spent.
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here.

Label: 1. Unnecessary word. If you were using "in spite" it would be okay to write "in spite of the distance", but "of" is not necessary when using "despite".

Prediction:  
1. Error: moral, Correction: morals
Explanation: The word "moral" is not a valid word. The correct word is "morals".
2. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanation: The word "the" is not a valid word. The correct word is "personal".

Label: 1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."

Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "birthday wishes." Either "birthday wishes" or "a birthday wish" would be acceptable.




Prediction:  1. The word 'thoughts' is the plural form of the word 'thought'. 2. The word 'personalities' is the plural form of the word 'personality'.
Label: 1. The singular noun "thought" refers to a single idea or opinion. For example, "I think I'd like eggs for breakfast" or "She thinks it would be fun to try beekeeping" are two thoughts. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "thoughts" should be pluralized.
2. The singular noun "personality" means a collection of traits, behaviors, or emotional qualities that make up an individual's character. The plural noun "personalities" refers to the personalities of multiple people.




Prediction:  The word "life" should be replaced with "lives".

Explanation: The word "much more" should be replaced with "much more".
Explanation: The word "a lot of" should be replaced with "a lot of".
Label: 1. The sentence mentions multiple people, so "life" should be pluralised, as there are multiple lives.

Prediction:   
1. The word "the" should not be used in this sentence because it is not a specific noun.
2. The word "relationship" should be changed to "relationships" because it is a plural noun.

2. When referencing relationships as a general concept, the plural "relationships" should be used because it references multiple relationships between many different people.

Label: 1. The noun "policy" requires either an article or pluralization. The definite article "the" refers to a specific policy, especially one that was mentioned earlier in the text.

Prediction:  
1. Error: the, Correction: In the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter . Explanation: The article "the" is missing before "past decades".
2. Error: are, Correction: were In the past decades , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .

4. Error: live, Correction: lived In the past decades , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using
Label: 1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."




Prediction:  The word "gene" is the singular form of the word "genes", and it is used in the sentence to refer to a specific gene or genetic material. In this case, the word "gene" should be replaced with the plural form "genes" to match the context.
2. Error: altering, Correction: altering
Explanations: The word "altering" is the present participle form of the verb "to alter", and it is used in the sentence to describe the action of changing or modifying something. In this case, the word "altering" should be replaced with the infinitive form "to alter" to match the context.
3. Error: the, Correction: a
Explanations: The word "the" is used in the sentence to refer to a specific application of altering genes, but in the context of the sentence, it is not clear which application is being referred to. In this case, the word "the" should be replaced with the indefinite article "a" to make the sentence more general.
4. Error: application, Correction: applications
Explanations: The word "application" is the singular form of the word "applications", and it is used in the sentence to refer to a specific application of altering
Label: 1. The technology to alter genetic material could be applied not just to a single gene but any and all genes. For that reason, it's correct to use the plural "genes" rather than the singular "gene."

2. The plural form "contacts" is replaced by the singular form "contact".

Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.




Prediction:  1. The word research is a singular noun, so it should be used in the singular form. 2. The word show is a verb, so it should be used in the present tense.
The erroneous sentence is: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
The correct sentence is: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
The errors in the erroneous sentence are:
1. Error: Researches, Correction: Research
2. Error: show, Correction: shows

2. The word show is a verb, so it should be used in the present tense.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction, followed by the explicit errors in this sentence. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Erroneous sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Errors:
1.
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.




Prediction:  The preposition “of” is used to indicate possession or relationship. The preposition “for” is used to indicate purpose. The correct preposition here is “for”.
2. Error: their, Correction: they’re
Explanations: The word “their” is a possessive pronoun that refers to a noun that is owned by them. The word “they’re” is a contraction of “they are”. The correct word here is “they’re”.
3. Error: express, Correction: express
Explanations: The verb “express” means to say or show something in a clear and direct way. The verb “express” means to show something in a clear and direct way. The correct verb here is “express”.
4. Error: own, Correction: own
Explanations: The adjective “own” means belonging to someone. The adjective “own” means belonging to someone. The correct adjective here is “own”.
5. Error: and, Correction: and
Explanations: The conjunction “and” is used to connect two or more things. The conjunction “and” is used to connect two or more things. The correct conjunction here is “and”.
6. Error: opinions, Correction: opinions
Explanations
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the skill of writing) with regard to whom (a person).




Prediction:  The word discriminate is a verb. It means to treat someone or something differently from others. The word against is a preposition. It means to be in opposition to someone or something. The word them is a pronoun. It refers to the people with limitations.
2. Error:  , Correction: realize
Explanations: The word realize is a verb. It means to become aware of something. The word them is a pronoun. It refers to the people with limitations.
3. Error:  , Correction: do it
Explanations: The word do is a verb. It means to perform an action. The word it is a pronoun. It refers to the action of discriminating against people with limitations.
4. Error:  , Correction: with or without them
Explanations: The word with is a preposition. It means in the company of someone or something. The word without is a preposition. It means not in the company of someone or something. The word them is a pronoun. It refers to the people with limitations.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction, followed by the explicit errors in this sentence. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.Erroneous sentence: While we
Label: 1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."




Prediction:  1. The sentence is missing a comma before products. 2. The word system is in the singular form, but the word products is in the plural form. The word systems is the plural form of the word system, so the word systems should be used instead of the word system.

Label: 1. Use a full stop to separate these two sentences.
2. The sentence is talking about systems in general, so "system" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  In this case, the error is that the verb becomes is used in the wrong tense. The verb becomes is the third person singular present tense form of the verb become. The correct tense here is the third person singular present perfect form of the verb become, which is becomes.
2. Error: expressing, Correction: expressed
Explanations: In this case, the error is that the verb expressed is used in the wrong tense. The verb expressed is the past tense form of the verb express. The correct tense here is the present perfect form of the verb express, which is expressed.
3. Error: communicating, Correction: communicated
Explanations: In this case, the error is that the verb communicated is used in the wrong tense. The verb communicated is the past tense form of the verb communicate. The correct tense here is the present perfect form of the verb communicate, which is communicated.
4. Error: face, Correction: faces
Explanations: In this case, the error is that the noun faces is used in the wrong form. The noun faces is the plural form of the noun face. The correct form here is the singular form of the noun face, which is face.
5. Error: people, Correction: person
Explanations:
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. "Expressing themselves" is the third person singular, so use "becomes" to correspond with it.




Prediction:  The error is a mistake in the preposition. The preposition should be the because the internet is a thing and we cannot transfer a thing to life. We can transfer a thing to another thing.
2. Error:  , Correction: internet
Explanations: The error is a mistake in the article. The article should be the because the internet is a thing and we cannot transfer a thing to life. We can transfer a thing to another thing.
3. Error:  , Correction: real
Explanations: The error is a mistake in the article. The article should be the because life is a thing and we cannot transfer a thing to life. We can transfer a thing to another thing.
Note that the erroneous sentence can contain multiple errors and that the errors are given in the order they appear in the sentence. Each error is described by its position in the sentence (the position of the first letter of the erroneous word) and the erroneous word.
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Prediction:  
1. Others is a plural form of the word other. It is incorrect in the context of the sentence because we are talking about a single person here. So, the correct word is other. 
2. Aspect is a noun that refers to a part of something. Role is a noun that refers to the function or part played by a person or thing in a particular situation. In this case, we are talking about the importance of face-to-face human interaction in our life, so the correct word is role.

Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".

Prediction:  1. The apostrophe is in the wrong place, it should be after the letter s.
2. Error: Forest'view, Correction: Forest 's view
Explanations: 2. The apostrophe is in the wrong place, it should be after the letter s.
3. Error: Forest'view, Correction: Forest 's view
Explanations: 3. The apostrophe is in the wrong place, it should be after the letter s.
4. Error: Forest'view, Correction: Forest 's view
Explanations: 4. The apostrophe is in the wrong place, it should be after the letter s.
5. Error: Forest'view, Correction: Forest 's view
Explanations: 5. The apostrophe is in the wrong place, it should be after the letter s.
6. Error: Forest'view, Correction: Forest 's view
Explanations: 6. The apostrophe is in the wrong place, it should be after the letter s.
7. Error: Forest'view, Correction: Forest 's view
Explanations: 7. The apostrophe is in the wrong place, it should be after the letter s.
8.
Label: 1. An "s" and a space are missing. There should be an "s" after the apostrophe and "view" should be a separate word.




Prediction:  1. The word length is not a noun and therefore cannot be the object of the preposition to.
2. The word shorter is not an adjective and therefore cannot be the complement of the adjective as.
```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    string s;
    while(cin>>s)
    {
        int i=0;
        for(int j=0;j<s.size();j++)
        {
            if(s[j]==' ')
            {
                i++;
            }
        }
        if(i>1)
        {
            cout<<"Error: "<<s<<endl;
            cout<<"Correction: "<<s.substr(0,s.find(' '))<<s.substr(s.rfind(' ')+1,s.size()-s.rfind(' ')-1)<<endl;
            cout<<"Explanation: "<<endl;
            cout<<"1. The word "<<s.substr(0,s.find(' '))<<" is not a noun and therefore cannot be the object of the preposition to."<<endl;
            cout<<"2. The word "<<s.substr(s.rfind(' ')+1,s.size()-s.rfind(' ')-1)<<" is not an adjective and therefore cannot be the complement of the adjective as."<<endl;
        }

Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".




Prediction:  1. dignosis is not a word. It should be diagnosis.
2. Seconly is not a word. It should be Secondly.
Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer K(≤ 10) which is the number of erroneous sentences. Then K erroneous sentences are given, each of which contains no more than 80 words. Each word is a sequence of lowercase English letters, and there is only one space between two consecutive words. After the last erroneous sentence, there is a line that contains 10 words which are the explicit errors in the erroneous sentences. Each word in the last line is a sequence of lowercase English letters, and there is only one space between two consecutive words.
For each erroneous sentence, print the corresponding explanations in one line. Output format is the same as the format of explanations in the sample.
You can print one explanatory sentence for each error, or you can print multiple explanatory sentences for one error.
Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carrier .
1. dignosis is not a word. It should be diagnosis.
2. Seconly is not a word. It should be Secondly.

Label: 1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "diagnosis".
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "Secondly".




Prediction:  1. The word "under" is redundant in this sentence. It is not necessary to use it. 2. The word "the" is missing in this sentence. It is not necessary to use it.
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.




Prediction:  The word “a” is used as an article, but it should be “the” instead.
2. Error: habit, Correction: habits
Explanations: The word “habit” is used as a singular noun, but it should be “habits” instead.
3. Error: arise, Correction: arise
Explanations: The word “arise” is used as a verb, but it should be “arise” instead.
4. Error: and, Correction: and
Explanations: The word “and” is used as a conjunction, but it should be “and” instead.
5. Error: better, Correction: better
Explanations: The word “better” is used as an adverb, but it should be “better” instead.
6. Error: for, Correction: for
Explanations: The word “for” is used as a preposition, but it should be “for” instead.
7. Error: rest, Correction: rest
Explanations: The word “rest” is used as a noun, but it should be “rest” instead.
8. Error: their, Correction: their
Explanations: The word “their” is used as a possessive adjective
Label: 1. The construction "the earlier A, the better B" is talking about specifics, with a greater focus on B. As such, B requires an article, and as you are talking about something specific, you should use the definite article, "the".




Prediction:  the should be a
2. Error: it, Correction: the
Explanations: it should be the
3. Error: carriers, Correction: carrier
Explanations: carriers should be carrier
4. Error: genetic, Correction: genetic
Explanations: genetic should be genetic

Explanations: testing should be testing
13. Error: result, Correction: result
Explanations: result should be result
14. Error: is, Correction: is
Explanations: is should be is
15. Error:
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "As the result" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a result," which implies that the outcome is one of several.




Prediction:  In the given sentence, the word “supports” is misspelled. It should be “support”.
2. Error: him/her, Correction: him or her
Explanations: In the given sentence, the phrase “him/her” is incorrect. It should be “him or her”.
3. Error: to inform, Correction: to inform
Explanations: In the given sentence, the phrase “to inform” is incorrect. It should be “to inform”.
4. Error: standing of such junction, Correction: standing at such junction
Explanations: In the given sentence, the phrase “standing of such junction” is incorrect. It should be “standing at such junction”.
5. Error: whether should him/her, Correction: whether he/she should
Explanations: In the given sentence, the phrase “whether should him/her” is incorrect. It should be “whether he/she should”.
Explanation: In the given sentence, the word “supports” is misspelled. It should be “support”. The phrase “him/her” is incorrect. It should be “him or her”. The phrase “to inform” is incorrect. It should be “to inform”. The phrase “standing of such junction” is incorrect. It should
Label: 1. In the context of care and aid from other people, the word "support" is an uncountable noun and is not pluralized. It generally refers to actions or gestures, which are not tangible and cannot be counted. The word "supports" is a verb form or a noun referring to the structural components of a building that allow it to withstand force.




Prediction:  
1. It is not necessary to use an article before the word 'research' as it is a general term. 
2. The word 'Facebook' should be capitalized as it is a proper noun. 
3. The word 'users' should be pluralized as it refers to multiple people. 

Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. This sentence is talking about users in general and therefore should not have an article.
3. "Facebook" is a proper noun and therefore should not have an article.




Prediction:  " to " should be " of ", which is the preposition.
2. Error: a, Correction: the
Explanations: " a " should be " the ", which is the determiner.
3. Error: one, Correction: the
Explanations: " one " should be " the ", which is the determiner.
4. Error: family, Correction: families
Explanations: " family " should be " families ", which is the plural form.
5. Error: have, Correction: has
Explanations: " have " should be " has ", which is the singular form.
6. Error: it, Correction: him
Explanations: " it " should be " him ", which is the pronoun.
7. Error: this, Correction: that
Explanations: " this " should be " that ", which is the determiner.
8. Error: problem, Correction: problem
Explanations: " problem " should be " problem ", which is the noun.
9. Error: by, Correction: by
Explanations: " by " should be " by ", which is the preposition.
10. Error: family, Correction: families
Explanations: " family " should be
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. As "risk" is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".




Prediction: 
Label: 1. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and "the computer" meaning one computer specifically.
2. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing laptops as a general concept, the plural "laptops" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "laptop" is used to refer to an individual laptop, with "a laptop" meaning any laptop and "the laptop" meaning one laptop specifically.
3. The plural noun "tablet" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing tablets as a general concept, the plural "tablets" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "tablet" is used to refer to an individual tablet, with "a tablet" meaning any tablet and "the tablet" meaning one tablet specifically.
4. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.
5. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "did" implies that the phone is no longer involved in people's work, so it should be the present tense "do" instead.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. Unnecessary comma. The position of the comma is grammatically incorrect.
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "reflected".




Prediction:  1. on is not the correct preposition to use with agree, the correct preposition is with.
2. argument is not the correct noun to use with agree, the correct noun is statement.

Label: 1. If you "agree on" something it usually means you reach a compromise with someone. When talking about an opinion and saying whether you agree or disagree, "agree" is usually followed by the preposition "with".
2. Incorrect word choice. This is an opinion/assertion that is being stated, so use "statement".




Prediction:  1. with is not the correct preposition to be used here. It should be 'the' instead. 2. have is not the correct verb form to be used here. It should be 'has' instead.

Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".




Prediction:  
1.  The preposition "of" is incorrect here. The correct preposition here is "on". 
2.  The word "the" is incorrect here. The word "the" is used when we are referring to something specific. However, in this sentence, "social media" is not referring to a specific social media. It is referring to social media in general. Therefore, the word "the" is not appropriate here. 
3.  The word "cyber" is incorrect here. The word "cyber" is used to refer to the internet. However, in this sentence, "socialises through the cyber" is not referring to the internet. It is referring to a society that socialises through the internet. Therefore, the word "cyber" is not appropriate here.
Label: 1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.




Prediction:  In the erroneous sentence, the word 'provides' is followed by the word 'a' which is a determiner. However, the correct sentence uses the preposition 'with' instead of 'a' after the word 'provides'.
2. Error:  , Correction: people
Explanations: In the erroneous sentence, the word 'people' is followed by the word 'a' which is a determiner. However, the correct sentence uses the preposition 'with' instead of 'a' after the word 'people'.
3. Error:  , Correction: as
Explanations: In the erroneous sentence, the word 'never' is followed by the word 'be' which is a verb. However, the correct sentence uses the preposition 'as' instead of 'be' after the word 'never'.
4. Error:  , Correction: way
Explanations: In the erroneous sentence, the word 'communication' is followed by the word 'of' which is a preposition. However, the correct sentence uses the noun 'way' instead of 'of' after the word 'communication'.
5. Error:  , Correction: way
Explanations: In the erroneous sentence, the word 'communication' is followed
Label: 1. Missing word. Use "with" to link "provides" and "a way of talking and chatting" so we know what is being provided by social media.

It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need. There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.

Label: 1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.




Prediction:  
1. "lesser" is not a correct word. The correct word is "less". 
2. "the" is not required.
Label: 1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.




Prediction:  1. The word “the” is missing in the sentence.
2. Error: latest , Correction: latest
Explanations: 2. The word “latest” is misspelled. The correct spelling is “latest”.

Explanation: The word
Label: 1. Missing article. As our planet is a countable noun but also the only one we know of, we call it "the world".




Prediction: 
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.




Prediction:  The word emotinal is not a valid English word. The correct word is emotional .
2. Error: thoughts, Correction: thoughts
Explanations: The word thoughts is not a valid English word. The correct word is thoughts .
3. Error: benign, Correction: benign

Explanations: meeting should be meeting
13. Error:  , Correction: each
Explanations: each should be each
14. Error:  , Correction: others
Explanations: others should be others
15. Error:
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is used when something exists in an unspecified manner or amount, or to express one out of multiple options. The phrase "convenient contact environment" means one potential environment out of many, with varying degrees of convenience. This condition is best expressed by the indefinite article "a."




Prediction:   
1. about should be replaced by of.  
2. the should be replaced by both.

Label: 1. The verb "discuss" does not take the preposition "about." While "about" is used with similar verbs like "tell" or "talk," in the case of "discuss," the object simply comes directly after, with no need for a preposition.
2. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.




Prediction:  
1. the, The word "the" is not needed here because "surveillance technology" is already a specific noun.
2. invading, "Invading" is not the correct word here. "Safeguarding" is the correct word to use in this context.
3. the, The word "the" is not needed here because "surveillance technology" is already a specific noun.

Label: 1. This sentence is talking about surveillance technology in general and therefore does not need an article.
2. None
3. The sentence is discussing human privacy in general, so it does not require an article.




Prediction:  
1. The word "genetic" is incorrect. The correct word is "genes".
2. The word "gene" is incorrect. The correct word is "genes".
Input Format

The following n lines each contain a single erroneous sentence, its correction, and a list of errors in the erroneous sentence. Each erroneous sentence, its correction, and a list of errors is separated by a single space.
Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 100
Output Format
For each erroneous sentence, output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence. Each explanation is written on a separate line.
Sample Input
3
Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary . Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary . Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Sample Output
1. The word "genetic" is incorrect. The correct word is "genes".
2. The word "gene" is incorrect. The correct word is "genes".
1. The word "genetic" is incorrect. The correct word is "genes".
2. The word "gene"
Label: 1. The adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted.
2. The word "some" means an unspecified amount or a large amount. It is usually used with plural nouns. Also, it is unlikely that there is only one gene that can only be inherited by a specific gender, so logically it is more likely to be the plural.




Prediction:  
1. Explanation: The word says is in the third person singular form, which is incorrect. The word say should be used instead.
2. Explanation: The word the is not needed in this sentence.

Label: 1. The subject here is the plural "people," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "say."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.




Prediction:  A verb form should be used to describe the action of time passing.
2. Error: friends, Correction: friend
Explanations: The noun form should be used to describe a person who is considered a friend.
3. Error: list, Correction: lists
Explanations: The plural form should be used to describe multiple friends on a list.
4. Error: needs, Correction: need
Explanations: The verb form should be used to describe the action of needing to redefine the meaning of friends.
5. Error: redefined, Correction: redefine
Explanations: The verb form should be used to describe the action of redefining the meaning of friends.
6. Error: friends, Correction: friend
Explanations: The noun form should be used to describe a person who is considered a friend.
7. Error: needs, Correction: need
Explanations: The verb form should be used to describe the action of needing to redefine the meaning of friends.
8. Error: redefined, Correction: redefine
Explanations: The verb form should be used to describe the action of redefining the meaning of friends.
9. Error: friends, Correction: friend
Explanations: The noun form should be used
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.




Prediction:  1. You are using the wrong form of the noun “skill” in the sentence. 2. You are using the wrong form of the verb “to be” in the sentence.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction, followed by the explicit errors in this sentence. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.Erroneous sentence: In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
Correct sentence: In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
Errors:
1. Error: skill, Correction: skills
2. Error: is, Correction: are
Explanations: 1. You are using the wrong form of the noun “skill” in the sentence. 2. You are using the wrong form of the verb “to be” in the sentence.
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Interpersonal skills" is the third person plural, so use "are" to correspond with it.




Prediction:  
1. The word "in" is not used correctly in this sentence. It should be "on". 
2. The word "the" is not used correctly in this sentence. It should be omitted. 
3. The word "image" is not used correctly in this sentence. It should be "images". 
4. The word "in" is not used correctly in this sentence. It should be "on". 
5. The word "do" is not used correctly in this sentence. It should be "not".

Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.




Prediction:  The correct form of the verb in the sentence is was .
2. Error: during, Correction: at
Explanations: The correct preposition to be used in the sentence is at .
3. Error: enough, Correction: enough to
Explanations: The correct form of the adverb is enough to .
4. Error: cure, Correction: cure him
Explanations: The correct form of the verb is cure him .
The first line contains the erroneous sentence and the second line contains the correct sentence. The third line contains the errors in the erroneous sentence, one error per line. The erroneous sentence and the correct sentence are both less than 100 characters long. Each error is a single word. There are at most 10 errors.
Output the explanations for the errors in the erroneous sentence. Each explanation should be on a separate line, and the explanations should be in the same order as the errors in the input.
Label: 1. Talking about something that happened in the past, so use the past tense "was".




Prediction:  1. The article the is not used before the word society.
2. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations: 2. The article the is not used before the word communication.
3. Error: between, Correction:  
Explanations: 3. The preposition between is not used before the word people.
4. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations: 4. The article the is not used before the word social.
5. Error: media, Correction:  
Explanations: 5. The noun social media is not written as two separate words.
6. Error: there, Correction:  
Explanations: 6. The pronoun there is not used before the word are.
7. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations: 7. The article the is not used before the word negative.
8. Error: impacts, Correction:  
Explanations: 8. The noun impact is not written as two separate words.
9. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations: 9. The article the is not used before the word society.
10. Error: while, Correction:  
Explanations: 10. The word while is not used before
Label: 1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific societies, instead of modern society in general.




Prediction:  
1. Error: study, Correction: studying
Explain: The correct form of the verb "study" is "studying" in this sentence. The verb should be in the present progressive tense.
2. Error: in, Correction:  
Explain: The preposition "in" is not needed in this sentence. The sentence is already clear without it.
3. Error: friend, Correction: friends
Explain: The noun "friend" is singular, so the correct form is "friends" in this sentence.

Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.




Prediction:  1. Error: Human, Correction: Humans
The word “Human” is the singular form of the noun “Humans”, which means it is referring to a single person or being. The correction “Humans” is the plural form of the noun “Humans”, which means it is referring to multiple people or beings. The correction is necessary because the sentence is referring to multiple people or beings.
2. Error: has, Correction: have
The word “has” is the third person singular present tense of the verb “to have”, which means it is referring to a single person or being. The correction “have” is the third person plural present tense of the verb “to have”, which means it is referring to multiple people or beings. The correction is necessary because the sentence is referring to multiple people or beings.
Explanation: 1. Error: Human, Correction: Humans
The word “Human” is the singular form of the noun “Humans”, which means it is referring to a single person or being. The correction “Humans” is the plural form of the noun “Humans”, which means it is referring to multiple people or beings. The correction is necessary because the sentence is referring to multiple people or beings.
Explanation: 2. Error: has, Correction
Label: 1. The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".




Prediction:  1. the internet is the name of a thing. 2. her is a pronoun, it is not used in this sentence because he is a pronoun.
Label: 1. Missing article. "Internet" is the name of a specific network, so use the definite article, "the".
2. The sentence starts with "He", referring to man, but the third person possessive you have used is the female version. Change to "his" to match with "He" and make it clear that you are talking about a man.




Prediction:  The word "for" is a preposition, but it is not used correctly in this sentence. It should be replaced with the word "of".
2. Error: rather, Correction: than  
Explanations: The word "rather" is used as a conjunction, but it is not used correctly in this sentence. It should be replaced with the word "than".
3. Error: one, Correction: one 's  
Explanations: The word "one" is used as a pronoun, but it is not used correctly in this sentence. It should be replaced with the word "one's".
4. Error: 's, Correction: 's  
Explanations: The apostrophe is used to indicate possession, but it is not used correctly in this sentence. It should be replaced with the word "s".
5. Error: social, Correction: social  
Explanations: The word "social" is used as an adjective, but it is not used correctly in this sentence. It should be replaced with the word "social".
6. Error: networks, Correction: networks  
Explanations: The word "networks" is used as a noun, but it is not used correctly in this sentence. It should be replaced with the
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Seek out" does not require the preposition "for" to indicate what is being sought out.




Prediction:  The verb "claim" is used for making a statement that is not true. For example, "I claim to be the fastest runner in the world." The verb "claimed" is used for past tense. For example, "I claimed to be the fastest runner in the world."
2. Error: they, Correction: they're
Explanations: "They're" is a contraction of "they are". It is used to express the present tense of the verb "to be". For example, "They're going to the park." "They are going to the park." "They're" is also used in questions. For example, "Are they going to the park?" "They're going to the park." "They are going to the park." "They're" is also used in negative sentences. For example, "They're not going to the park." "They are not going to the park."
3. Error: keep, Correction: keep in touch
Explanations: The verb "keep" is used for holding something in your possession. For example, "I keep my phone in my pocket." The verb "keep in touch" is used for maintaining contact with someone. For example, "I keep in touch with my friends on
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.




Prediction:  1. The verb comes is used in the third person singular, but the subject These is a plural noun. Therefore, the verb form come must be used. 2. The plural noun applications is the correct form of the noun application. 3. The preposition on is the correct form of the preposition in.
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "come" to go with "advantages".
2. The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.
3. We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".




Prediction:  The word “check” is the plural form of the word “check” and it is used here to describe the medical test that the family member will take in order to prevent the disease. However, the word “check” is not the correct word to use in this context because it is a noun, and it should be a verb. Therefore, the correct word to use is “checks”.
2. Error: creats, Correction: creates
Explanations: The word “creats” is an incorrect spelling of the word “creates”. The word “creats” is not a word in the English language, and it should be “creates”. Therefore, the correct spelling is “creates”.
3. Error: this, Correction: that
Explanations: The word “this” is used here to refer to the potential risk that the family member is scared of. However, the word “this” is not the correct word to use in this context because it is referring to a person or thing that is nearby. Therefore, the correct word to use is “that”.
4. Error: would, Correction: will
Explanations: The word “would” is used here to refer to the future tense of the verb “will”. However, the word
Label: 1. From the sentence we can surmise that the people would have more than one check, so the plural "checks" should be used.




Prediction:  The error is a subject-verb agreement error. The subject is the phrase "spend too much time on internet". The verb is "may". The verb "may" requires a singular subject, while "spend" is a plural verb. The correction is to change the verb to a singular verb "spending".
3. Error:  , Correction: on the internet
Explanations: The error is a preposition error. The preposition "on" is not used correctly. The phrase "spend too much time on internet" should be "spend too much time on the internet". The correction is to add the preposition "on" before the phrase "the internet".
4. Error:  , Correction: online social networks
Explanations: The error is a noun phrase error. The noun phrase "using online social networks" should be "using online social networks". The correction is to add the preposition "online" before the noun phrase "social networks".

Label: 1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.




Prediction:  
1. The word "Engineering" should be replaced with "The engineering" in the erroneous sentence. 
2. The word "fused" should be replaced with "process" in the erroneous sentence. 
3. The word "on" should be replaced with "current" in the erroneous sentence. 
4. The word "desired deeds" should be replaced with "desired" in the erroneous sentence. 

Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."




Prediction:  The word get is incorrect. The correct word is put.
2. Error: their, Correction: their
Explanations: The word their is incorrect. The correct word is their.
3. Error: who, Correction: that
Explanations: The word who is incorrect. The correct word is that.
4. Error: in, Correction: in
Explanations: The word in is incorrect. The correct word is in.
5. Error: danger, Correction: danger
Explanations: The word danger is incorrect. The correct word is danger.

    cout << "Explanations: The word " << error << " is incorrect
Label: 1. The phrase "put in danger" is a common expression and the verb does not change. The verb "put" means to cause someone to be in a particular place or position.




Prediction:  The error is caused by the confusion between the singular form of the noun “loss” and the past tense of the verb “lose”. The correct form is “loss”, which is the singular form of the noun.
2. Error: interpersonal, Correction: interpersonal
Explanations: The error is caused by the confusion between the adjective “interpersonal” and the noun “interpersonal”. The correct form is “interpersonal”, which is an adjective that describes a relationship between people.
3. Error: will, Correction: will
Explanations: The error is caused by the confusion between the modal verb “will” and the auxiliary verb “will”. The correct form is “will”, which is the modal verb that expresses future tense.
4. Error: cause, Correction: cause
Explanations: The error is caused by the confusion between the noun “cause” and the verb “cause”. The correct form is “cause”, which is the noun that refers to the reason for something.
5. Error: many, Correction: many
Explanations: The error is caused by the confusion between the adjective “many” and the determiner “many”. The correct form is “many”, which is the determiner that indicates a large number.
6. Error
Label: 1. The verb "cause" is always followed by a noun, and "lost" is the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed to the noun "loss." 




Prediction:  These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc.
These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc.

Explanation: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc.
Explanation: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc.
Explanation: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc.
Explanation: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc.
Explanation: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide global warming which gives rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc.
Explanation: These green house gases are the main cause of worldwide
Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.

Explanations: 


Label: 1. The statement is confusing two phrases: "keep confidential" and "in confidence." The phrase "keep confidential" is common and is used without variation in wording.




Prediction:  1. Use the singular form of the noun in a sentence.
2. Use the article the before a singular noun in a sentence.
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".




Prediction:  
1. The word  should be replaced by the word  .
2. The phrase  should be replaced by the phrase  .
3. The word  should be removed.
Note: You are given the number of errors in the erroneous sentence.
Label: 1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.
2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own.
3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.

Label: 1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.




Prediction:  The error in the sentence is due to the fact that the word medias should be replaced by media .
2. Error: on, Correction: in
Explanations: The error in the sentence is due to the fact that the word on should be replaced by in .
3. Error: Personally, Correction: I
Explanations: The error in the sentence is due to the fact that the word Personally should be replaced by I .
Label: 1. "Media" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralised.




Prediction:  
1. The word the should not be there.
2. The word contacts is plural, but the word contact is singular. 

Label: 1. "Contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. When used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.




Prediction:  
1. The word 'a' is an indefinite article. It should be replaced with the word 'an' because the word 'research' starts with a vowel sound. 
2. The word 'the' is a definite article. It should be replaced with the word 'a' because the word 'research' is a general term. 
3. The word 'the' is a definite article. It should be replaced with the word 'a' because the word 'users' is a general term.

Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.




Prediction:  The word "but" is used to indicate a contrast between two statements. It is used to show that the second statement is in contrast to the first statement. In the given sentence, the word "but" is used to show that the second statement is in contrast to the first statement. However, the second statement is not in contrast to the first statement. The second statement is not a contrast to the first statement. It is a continuation of the first statement. Therefore, the word "but" is not used correctly in the given sentence. It should be replaced with the word "and".
2. Error: guys, Correction: people
Explanations: The word "guys" is used to refer to a group of people. It is used to refer to a group of people in a friendly way. In the given sentence, the word "guys" is used to refer to a group of people. However, the word "guys" is not used correctly in the given sentence. It should be replaced with the word "people".
3. Error: social network website, Correction: social networking website
Explanations: The word "website" is used to refer to a website. It is used to refer to a website that is used to display
Label: 1. "But" should be used in the situation where you do one thing, but not the other, so you could say, "they don't speak to the people around them, but do communicate with friends on Facebook," but in the context of your sentence, you are saying that both these actions are going on at the same time, so you should use "and", as in they shun/ignore the people around them AND only communicate with friends on Facebook.




Prediction:  A dinner is a meal that is served in a restaurant.
2. Error: without any chatting , Correction: without any chatting
Explanations: The word chatting is used to describe the act of talking with someone.
3. Error: their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork . Correction: their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork

6. Error: when the other hand is holding a fork . Correction: when the other hand is holding a fork
Ex
Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner. A meal is still referred to in the singular when it is shared by multiple people. Therefore, it should be "having dinner" rather than "having dinners."




Prediction:  The word "dilemma" is the singular form of the word "dilemmas". You need to add an "s" to the end of the word "dilemma" to make it plural.
2. Error: rise, Correction: rises
Explanations: The word "rise" is the singular form of the word "rises". You need to add an "s" to the end of the word "rise" to make it plural.
3. Error: family-related, Correction: family-related
Explanations: The word "family-related" is a single adjective describing the noun "ethical dilemma". You need to add an "s" to the end of the word "family-related" to make it plural.
4. Error: ethical, Correction: ethical
Explanations: The word "ethical" is a single adjective describing the noun "dilemma". You need to add an "s" to the end of the word "ethical" to make it plural.
5. Error: dilemma, Correction: dilemmas
Explanations: The word "dilemma" is the singular form of the word "dilemmas". You need to add an "s" to the end of the word "dilemma

Explanations: The child is the subject of the sentence. The child is a third person singular noun, and the subject of the sentence is a third person singular noun.
5. Error: the same genetic risk as well, Correction: the same genetic risk
Explanations: The phrase the same genetic risk as well is redundant. The word as well is redundant.

Prediction:  The correct word is "times", not "time".
2. Error: overcome, Correction: overcome
Explanations: The correct word is "overcome", not "overcome".
3. Error: hard, Correction: hard
Explanations: The correct word is "hard", not "hard".

Explanations:
Label: 1. When generally referring to a period of hardship, time is pluralised, so the correct expression is "the hard times".




Prediction:  
1. The error is the use of "on" in the sentence. The correct word to use is "chatting". 
2. The error is the use of "skill" in the sentence. The correct word to use is "skills".

Label: 1. Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".
2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  1. The word "on" is used instead of "the". 2. The word "parent" is used instead of "parents".
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction, followed by the explicit errors in this sentence. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
The children rely the parent to live .
The children rely on the parents to live .
1. Error: , Correction: on
2. Error: parent, Correction: parents
Explanations: 1. The word "on" is used instead of "the". 2. The word "parent" is used instead of "parents".
Label: 1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
2. The subject is "children," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.




Prediction:  We should use the verb cause instead of causing in the sentence.
2. Error: may, Correction: might
Explanations: We should use the verb might instead of may in the sentence.
3. Error: harmful, Correction: harmful
Explanations: We should use the adjective harmful instead of harmful in the sentence.
4. Error: tremendous, Correction: tremendous
Explanations: We should use the adjective tremendous instead of tremendous in the sentence.
5. Error: effects, Correction: effect
Explanations: We should use the noun effect instead of effects in the sentence.
Label: 1. This sentence is not talking about something that is currently happening, but something that could happen, so you need to change the present continuous "causing" to the present "cause".

Explanations: 
4. Error: that, Correction:  
Explanations: 
5. Error: providing, Correction: providing 
Explanations: 

Label: 1. The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of to innovators in general.




Prediction:  It is not grammatically correct to say “the burden” as “burden” is a countable noun, so “a burden” is more appropriate.
2. Error: in, Correction: a
Explanations: It is not grammatically correct to say “in her family” as “her family” is a countable noun, so “a family” is more appropriate.
3. Error: her, Correction: the
Explanations: It is not grammatically correct to say “her family” as “family” is a countable noun, so “the family” is more appropriate.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."




Prediction:  The word “on” is a preposition and it should be replaced by the preposition “in” because the word “newspaper” is a noun.
2. Error: years, Correction: a few years ago
Explanations: The word “years” is a noun and it should be replaced by the phrase “a few years ago” because the phrase “a few years ago” is an adverb.

Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".

8. Error: laws, Correction:  
Explanations: The word laws is not used correctly in the sentence. It should be replaced with the word laws.
Explanation: The word if
Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.

Prediction:  1. The word  got  is incorrect. It should be  a . 2. The word  altitudes  is incorrect. It should be  attitudes . 3. The word  too  is incorrect. It should be  for .
Sample Input 1:

The first time when I saw the ocean , I was deeply impressed by the infinite and vastness of the sea .
1.
Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

Prediction:  The word 'status' is a noun that means a situation or position that someone is in. In this sentence, the word 'status' should be plural to be in agreement with the noun 'photos'.
2. Error: conversations, Correction: conversation
Explanations: The word 'conversation' is a noun that means a discussion between two or more people. In this sentence, the word 'conversations' should be singular to be in agreement with the noun 'photos'.
3. Error: blogs, Correction: blog
Explanations: The word 'blog' is a noun that means a personal website where someone writes about their life or thoughts. In this sentence, the word 'blogs' should be singular to be in agreement with the noun 'photos'.
4. Error: them, Correction: they
Explanations: The word 'them' is a pronoun that means the people or things that have been mentioned before. In this sentence, the word 'them' should be plural to be in agreement with the noun 'photos'.
5. Error: easily, Correction: easily
Explanations: The word 'easily' is an adverb that means without difficulty. In this sentence, the word 'easily' should be singular to be in
Label: 1. The list is talking about things in general, and so "status" should be pluralised to match "conversations", "blogs" and "photos".




Prediction:  1. He is not staying for another year in the secondary school , but in the university .
2. The university which he applied for is not the university he will enter , but the university which he wants to enter .
3. The secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in the secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .

Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.




Prediction:  1. The verb ‘are’ is in the present tense, which does not agree with the past tense ‘been’ in the sentence. The correct verb ‘have’ is in the present perfect tense, which agrees with the past tense ‘been’.
2. Error: also, Correction: also
Explanations: 2. The adverb ‘also’ is used to indicate that something is similar or equal to something else. It should be used after the verb ‘been’ to indicate that the implants and products have been used as surveillance tools as well.
3. Error: as, Correction: as
Explanations: 3. The preposition ‘as’ is used to indicate that something is used for a specific purpose. It should be used after the verb ‘been’ to indicate that the implants and products have been used as surveillance tools.
4. Error: tools, Correction: tools
Explanations: 4. The plural noun ‘tools’ is used to refer to a group of things. It should be used after the verb ‘been’ to indicate that the implants and products have been used as surveillance tools.
5. Error: These implants and products, Correction: These implants and products
Explanations: 5. The
Label: 1. The perfect present tense should be used to show that the action of using implants and products is currently still happening. To create the perfect present, we use "have" and the past participle "used." 




Prediction:  
1. The word "in" is not used in this context. It should be replaced with "on" or "to".
2. The word "life" is singular, but the correction is plural. It should be changed to "lives".
3. The word "effect" is singular, but the correction is plural. It should be changed to "effects".

Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
3. This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.

The word immediate should be used when referring to something that happens at a specific time. The word immediate should be used when referring to something that happens at a specific time. The
Label: 1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".




Prediction:  1. The word bonds is a plural form of the verb bond , which means to join or unite . The correct form is bond . 2. The word human is a singular noun that refers to a person .

3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "live" to go with "humans".
4. "Aid" used in the sense of help or assistance is an uncountable noun and therefore should not be pluralised.

Label: 1. The concept of "genetic testing" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific type or instance of genetic testing, instead of the concept in general.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so use the plural "groups".
2. This connects back to "family members" at the beginning of the sentence, so you need to use the plural, "are", as in "Family members are a crucial factor...".

Prediction:  
1. The correction uses the verb "use" instead of the verb "create" because the action of "using" is more appropriate for the context of the sentence. The verb "create" would imply that the material is being made from scratch, which is not the case in this situation.
2. The correction removes the article "a" because it is not necessary in this sentence. The word "material" is already singular, so there is no need to specify a particular one.
3. The correction removes the article "the" because it is not necessary in this sentence. The word "buildings" is already plural, so there is no need to specify a particular one.
4. The correction uses the preposition "during" instead of "despite" because it is more appropriate for the context of the sentence. The preposition "despite" implies that the material is able to withstand the natural disaster despite the fact that it is not designed to do so, which is not the case in this situation. The preposition "during" implies that the material is designed to withstand the natural disaster, which is more appropriate for the context of the sentence.
5. The correction uses the plural form "disasters" instead of "disaster" because it
Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.
