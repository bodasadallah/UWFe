Prediction:  
1. "Qualified" is an adjective and therefore should not be used as a noun.
2. "Resource" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.
Erroneous sentence: The first step is to make sure that the person is not in a life-threatening situation , and then call 911 .

cleaned: 1. "Qualified" is an adjective and therefore should not be used as a noun.
2. "Resource" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle. 




Prediction:  
1. "On the other side" is a common idiom, but it is not used in this context. "On the other hand" is a more appropriate idiom.
2. "Wants" is the third person singular, so use it instead of "want".
Erroneous sentence: The first thing that they should do is to tell their family members about the genetic disorder .
Correct sentence: The first thing that they should do is to tell their family members about the genetic disorder .
Errors:
1. Error: that, Correction:  
2. Error: is, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. "That" is not needed here. "The first thing that they should do" is a complete sentence, so you do not need to add "that" to make it a complete sentence.
2. "Is" is not needed here. "The first thing that they should do" is a complete sentence, so you do not need to add "is" to make it a complete sentence.
Erroneous sentence: The second thing that they should do is to tell their friends about the genetic disorder .
Correct sentence: The second thing that they should do is to tell their friends about the genetic disorder .
Errors:
1. Error: that
cleaned: 1. "On the other side" is a common idiom, but it is not used in this context. "On the other hand" is a more appropriate idiom.
2. "Wants" is the third person singular, so use it instead of "want".
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Prediction:  
1. The sentence is talking about multiple disadvantages, so use the plural form, "disadvantages".
2. The sentence is talking about the disadvantages in general, so use the indefinite article, "a".
3. The sentence is talking about the loss of interest, so use the preposition "in" instead of "of".
Erroneous sentence: However , it is not a good idea to completely cut off the usage of social media sites , as it is a good way to keep in touch with our friends and family .
Correct sentence: However , it is not a good idea to completely cut off the usage of social media sites , as it is a good way to keep in touch with our friends and family .
Errors:
1. Error: cut off, Correction: cut off
Explanations:
1. The verb "cut off" is always followed by a noun, and "usage" is a noun. Therefore, it should be changed to "cut off the usage of social media sites".

cleaned: 1. The sentence is talking about multiple disadvantages, so use the plural form, "disadvantages".
2. The sentence is talking about the disadvantages in general, so use the indefinite article, "a".
3. The sentence is talking about the loss of interest, so use the preposition "in" instead of "of".
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.




Prediction:  
1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.
Erroneous sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Correct sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spending too much time on the internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Errors:
1. Error: spend, Correction: spending
2. Error:  , Correction: the
Explanations:
1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.
Erroneous sentence: Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of

cleaned: 1. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the purpose of an action. In this case, the purpose of the action of leaking information is to receive cash reimbursement.
Label: 1. The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.




Prediction:  
1. The plural noun "researches" refers to multiple studies or investigations. The singular noun "research" refers to a single study or investigation. In this sentence, the author is referring to a single study, so "research" should be used.
2. The verb "show" is used to describe a single event or action. The verb "shows" is used to describe multiple events or actions. In this sentence, the author is referring to a single study, so "shows" should be used.
Erroneous sentence: The first step is to identify the problem and the second step is to find the solution .
Correct sentence: The first step is to identify the problem and the second step is to find a solution .
Errors:
1. Error: the solution, Correction: a solution
Explanations:
1. The noun "solution" refers to a single answer or solution to a problem. The noun "solutions" refers to multiple answers or solutions to a problem. In this sentence, the author is referring to a single solution, so "a solution" should be used.
Erroneous sentence: The first step is to identify the problem and the second step is to find the solution .
Correct sentence: The first step is to identify the problem
cleaned: 1. The plural noun "researches" refers to multiple studies or investigations. The singular noun "research" refers to a single study or investigation. In this sentence, the author is referring to a single study, so "research" should be used.
2. The verb "show" is used to describe a single event or action. The verb "shows" is used to describe multiple events or actions. In this sentence, the author is referring to a single study, so "shows" should be used.
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Prediction:  
1. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the reason) with regard to whom (the halt of the work).
2. "Halt" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
3. "Work" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
4. "Authorities" is a plural noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.
Erroneous sentence: The reason why the underground traffic system was not built in Harbin was that the higher level of authorities thought it was not necessary .

3. "Work" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
4. "Authorities" is a plural noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.

1. The preposition "on" is used to indicate that something is dependent on something else. The phrase "rely on" is a common expression and the preposition does not change.

2. The noun "parent" is singular and takes the singular verb "rely." The noun "parents" is plural and takes the plural verb "rely."
Label: 1. Missing word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. This sentence is either referring to the parents of specific children, or parents and children in general, but either way, "parents" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  
1. The phrase "in a nutshell" means "in a brief summary". The word "a" is used to refer to a single summary, while "the" is used to refer to a specific summary that was mentioned earlier in the text. Because no such summary was mentioned, it should be changed to "a".

Label: 1. "In a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. The phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but the specificity of "the" makes it sound literal. Instead of referring figuratively to something very simple, it would mean something that is literally inside a nutshell.

Prediction:  
1. The sentence is a contrast to the previous sentence, so it should be introduced with "However." The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing.

2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.

The phrase "the parents' right" is correct, but it is not clear what the right is. The phrase "the right to know" is correct, but it is not clear what is being known. The phrase "the right to know the healthiness of their child" is correct and unambiguous.

The phrase "the right to know the healthiness of their child" is correct and unambiguous.

Prediction:

Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "believe."




Prediction:  
1. The phrase "to make" is used to indicate that something is being created. The phrase "from making" is used to indicate that something is being stopped from being created. This sentence is explaining that engineers are discouraged from making more effort to do research and design, so the phrase "from making" is used.
2. The phrase "for" is used to indicate the reason for something. The phrase "and" is used to indicate the result of something. This sentence is explaining that engineers are discouraged from making more effort to do research and design, and that they have little motivation to work hard. The phrase "and" is used to indicate the result of the discouragement.
3. The phrase "will have" is used to indicate that something will happen in the future. The phrase "have" is used to indicate that something is happening in the present. This sentence is explaining that engineers have little motivation to work hard, so the phrase "have" is used.
Erroneous sentence: The reason is that the government has not provided enough funds for the project .

cleaned: 1. The phrase "to make" is used to indicate that something is being created. The phrase "from making" is used to indicate that something is being stopped from being created. This sentence is explaining that engineers are discouraged from making more effort to do research and design, so the phrase "from making" is used.
2. The phrase "for" is used to indicate the reason for something. The phrase "and" is used to indicate the result of something. This sentence is explaining that engineers are discouraged from making more effort to do research and design, and that they have little motivation to work hard. The phrase "and" is used to indicate the result of the discouragement.
3. The phrase "will have" is used to indicate that something will happen in the future. The phrase "have" is used to indicate that something is happening in the present. This sentence is explaining that engineers have little motivation to work hard, so the phrase "have" is used.
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."




Prediction:  
1. The possessive form of "other" is "others'".

Prediction:  
1. "Transfer" is a verb that means to move something from one place to another. "Transferred" is the past tense of "transfer". The sentence is talking about what happens to the information after it is recorded, so the past tense is necessary.

Label: 1. This is the passive voice, continuing from the phrase "is recorded." The passive voice requires a form of the verb "to be" followed by a secondary verb, which is always the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "transfer" to the past participle "transferred."




Prediction:  
1. "Shwing" is not a word. It should be "showing".
2. "Experience" is singular, so it should be "experiences" when it is used as a plural noun.

2. "Experience" is singular, so it should be "experiences" when it is used as a plural noun.
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."
2. The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.




Prediction:  
1. "More" is an adverb, and "easier" is an adjective, so they cannot be used together. "More" is used to compare two nouns, and "easier" is used to compare two adjectives. In this case, "easier" is being used to compare two actions, so it should be used on its own.

Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Prediction:  1. "With" is used to indicate that something is in the company of something else. "To" is used to indicate that something is directed towards something else. In this sentence, the intended meaning is that people are not talking to each other, so "to" should be used instead of "with".
2. "To" is used to indicate that something is directed towards something else. "Face to" is used to indicate that something is facing something else. In this sentence, the intended meaning is that people are facing their phones, so "face their phones" should be used instead of "face to their phones".

In this sentence, the intended meaning is that people are facing their phones, so "face their phones" should be used instead of "face to their phones".
Label: 1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.




Prediction:  
1. The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .

Prediction:  
1. The verb "happen" is used in the present tense, so the present tense form "happens" should be used.
2. The phrase "this is" is used to refer to the general concept of "this," so it should be omitted.
3. The phrase "in the country" is used to refer to a specific country, so the definite article "the" should be omitted.
4. The phrase "countries which are much larger than Singapore" is used to refer to a group of countries, so the verb form "are" should be used.
5. The phrase "find the child back" is used to refer to the general concept of "finding the child back," so the definite article "the" should be omitted.

5. The phrase "find the child back" is used to refer to the general concept of "finding the child back," so the definite article "the" should be omitted.
Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.




Prediction:  
1. Incorrect plural. "Challenge" is a countable noun, but it is not pluralized in the same way as other countable nouns. "Challenges" is the plural form of "challenge" when it is used as a verb, but "challenge" is the plural form of "challenge" when it is used as a noun.

Label: 1. The pronoun "another" means "one more," so it is singular and cannot be used with the plural "challenges." The singular "challenge" should be used instead.




Prediction:  
1. The noun "issue" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular issue, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "more popular" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Issue" is treated as the third person singular, so use "have" to correspond with it.
3. The phrase "in the first place" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a preposition, and "in" is a preposition, so it should be changed to "in."

Prediction:  
1. The verb "has" is used for singular subjects and "have" is used for plural subjects. The subject "both of his parents" is plural, so the verb should be "have."
2. The phrase "at high risk" is a common expression and the preposition does not change. The preposition "at" means in a particular place or position.
3. The phrase "at high risk" is a common expression and the preposition does not change. The preposition "at" means in a particular place or position.

2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.

Prediction:  
1. "Shall" is used to express a command or an obligation, while "should" is used to express a recommendation or a suggestion. In this case, the speaker is expressing a recommendation, so "should" should be used instead of "shall."

3. "And" is used to indicate that two things are both true, while "or" is used to indicate that one of two things is true. In this case, the speaker is expressing a recommendation, so "or" should be used instead of "and."
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.




Prediction:  
1. "Corporate" is an adjective that describes the noun "world", so you should use "the" before it.
2. "Network" is a countable noun, so you should use the plural "networks" to correspond with the plural "employees".
3. "Spend" is a verb that is used in the present tense, so you should use the present participle "spending" to correspond with it.

Explanations:
1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.

cleaned: 1. "Corporate" is an adjective that describes the noun "world", so you should use "the" before it.
2. "Network" is a countable noun, so you should use the plural "networks" to correspond with the plural "employees".
3. "Spend" is a verb that is used in the present tense, so you should use the present participle "spending" to correspond with it.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."




Prediction:  
1. The phrase "the more of the writing skills" is redundant. The phrase "the more" already implies that there is a quantity of something, so the phrase "of the writing skills" is unnecessary. The phrase "the more of the writing skills" can be replaced with "the more writing skills."
2. The phrase "the more time used in the social media sites" is redundant. The phrase "in the social media sites" already implies that the time is being used on the social media sites, so the phrase "in the social media sites" is unnecessary.

2. The phrase "the more time used in the social media sites" is redundant. The phrase "in the social media sites" already implies that the time is being used on the social media sites, so the phrase "in the social media sites" is unnecessary. The phrase "the more time used in the social media sites" can be replaced with "the more time used on the social media sites."
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Prediction:  
1. The preposition "of" is used to show possession, so it doesn't make sense to say "despite of the distance". The preposition "despite" is used to show that something is true despite something else, so "despite the distance" means that the sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance.

2. The word "show" is a verb and should be pluralized as "shows" when referring to more than one research.
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.

Label: 1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."

Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".

Prediction:  
1. The phrase "go to great length" means to go to great lengths. The phrase "as shorter as they can" means as short as they can. Therefore, the phrase "as shorter as they can" should be changed to "as short as they can."

1. The phrase "but also" means "in addition to". Therefore
cleaned: 1. The phrase "go to great length" means to go to great lengths. The phrase "as shorter as they can" means as short as they can. Therefore, the phrase "as shorter as they can" should be changed to "as short as they can."
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".

Prediction:  
1. "Serendipity" is a noun that refers to the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery. Therefore, it should be "the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery" instead of "a discovery under an accidental case."
2. "Result" is a verb that means to bring about or cause something to happen. "Result in" is a phrasal verb that means to bring about or cause something to happen. Therefore, "result" should be changed to "result in."
Erroneous sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people .

cleaned: 1. "Serendipity" is a noun that refers to the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery. Therefore, it should be "the phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery" instead of "a discovery under an accidental case."
2. "Result" is a verb that means to bring about or cause something to happen. "Result in" is a phrasal verb that means to bring about or cause something to happen. Therefore, "result" should be changed to "result in."
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.

Prediction:  1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the result" implies that there is only one result. The phrase "a result," with the indefinite article "a," implies that there are many possible results. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a result."

"As the result" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a result," which implies that the outcome is one of several.

cleaned: 1. The phrase "I do not agree on" is incorrect. The correct phrase is "I do not agree with."
2. The phrase "I do not agree with this argument" is incorrect. The correct phrase is "I do not agree with this statement."
Label: 1. If you "agree on" something it usually means you reach a compromise with someone. When talking about an opinion and saying whether you agree or disagree, "agree" is usually followed by the preposition "with".
2. Incorrect word choice. This is an opinion/assertion that is being stated, so use "statement".




Prediction:  
1. "With" is used to introduce an object or instrument, so it is not appropriate here. "Existence" is a noun, so it is not appropriate to use "with" before it. Instead, "the existence of" is used.

2. The subject is "existence," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "has" for subject-verb agreement.
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".




Prediction:  
1. The preposition "on" is used to indicate a relationship between two things, such as a relationship between a person and an object. The preposition "of" is used to indicate a relationship between a person and a group, such as a relationship between a person and a group of people. The phrase "the social media" implies that the social media is a group of people, so it should be changed to "on social media."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media platform instead of social media in general.

2. The concept of "population in China" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific population in China instead of the general concept.
Label: 1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.

2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.

Prediction:  
1. The verb "study" is in the present progressive tense, so it should be conjugated as "studying."

1. The concept of "technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific advancement instead of the progress of technology in general.
Erroneous sentence: While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem
cleaned: 1. The verb "study" is in the present progressive tense, so it should be conjugated as "studying."
2. The preposition "in" is used to indicate a location, but the phrase "study in oversea" is not a location. The preposition "oversea" is used to indicate that the study is taking place in a foreign country.
3. The word "friend" is singular, so it should be used with the singular pronoun "my." The word "friends" is plural, so it should be used with the plural pronoun "my."
Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.




Prediction:  
1. "Human" is a singular noun, so it should be used with a singular verb. 
2. "Have" is a plural verb, so it should be used with a plural subject.

Prediction:  
1. Missing article. As our planet is a countable noun but also the only one we know of, we call it "the world".
2. The pronoun "her" refers to the daughter, who is a female. The pronoun "his" refers to the father, who is a male.
Erroneous sentence: The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Correct sentence: The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic devices until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Errors:
1. Error: device, Correction: devices
Explanations:
1. Auto-correct is a feature that is common to many different electronic devices, so the plural "devices" should be used. The singular "device" is used to refer to individual devices, with "a device" meaning any device and "the device" meaning one specific device.

2. The sentence starts with "He", referring to man, but the third person possessive you have used is the female version. Change to "his" to match with "He" and make it clear that you are talking about a man.




Prediction:  
1. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the skill of writing) with regard to whom (a person).
Erroneous sentence: The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people .

cleaned: 1. The subject here is the plural "teenagers," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "claim."
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.




Prediction:  
1. The verb "comes" is singular, so it should be changed to "come" to match the plural subject "advantages."
2. The list is talking about things in general, and so "application" should be pluralised to match "advantages."
3. The phrase "on our smartphones" is a collocation, and "on" is used to refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
Erroneous sentence: However , the disadvantages of social media are more than the advantages .
Correct sentence: However , the disadvantages of social media outweigh the advantages .
Errors:
1. Error: are, Correction: outweigh
Explanations:
1. The verb "outweigh" is used to compare two things. It is used when one thing is more important than another. In this case, the disadvantages of social media are more important than the advantages.
Erroneous sentence: The disadvantages of social media are that it can be addictive , it can be used to bully people , it can be used to spread rumors and it can be used to spread fake news .

2. The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.
3. We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".

cleaned: 1. The list is talking about things in general, and so "check" should be pluralised to match "medicine".
Label: 1. From the sentence we can surmise that the people would have more than one check, so the plural "checks" should be used.




Prediction:  1. The present participle "spending" is used to describe an action that is currently ongoing. The past tense "spent" refers to an action that has already been completed. The present participle "spending" is used in this sentence because the author is describing an ongoing action. 2. "Internet" is a common noun that refers to the internet in general. It should be preceded by the definite article "the" to indicate that it is a specific internet that is being referred to.
Erroneous sentence: The first reason is that the social media can be used to share the information and knowledge .
Correct sentence: The first reason is that social media can be used to share information and knowledge .
Errors:
1. Error: The, Correction: Social
Explanations:
1. The definite article "the" is used before a noun that refers to a specific person, place, or thing. In this sentence, "social media" is a general term that refers to a broad category of online platforms, so the indefinite article "a" should be used instead of the definite article "the".
Erroneous sentence: The second reason is that the social media can be used to share the information and knowledge .
Correct sentence: The second reason is

The present participle "spending" is used in this sentence because the author is describing an ongoing action. 2. "Internet" is a common noun that refers to the internet in general. It should be preceded by the definite article "the" to indicate that it is a specific internet that is being referred to.
Label: 1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.




Prediction:  
1. The article "the" is missing. The engineering design process is a specific process, so it should be preceded by "the."
2. The verb "fuse" means to join two things together, but it is not used in this sense in the context of engineering design. The verb "fuse" is used in the context of engineering design to mean to combine two or more things into a single thing, but this is not the meaning intended here.

Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."




Prediction:  
1. The verb "get" is used to indicate that someone or something receives something. In this sentence, the author is talking about the danger that the loved ones of the person who is not telling the truth are in. The danger is not being received by the loved ones, but rather being put upon them by the person who is not telling the truth. Therefore, the verb "put" is more appropriate.

Prediction:  
1. "Cause" is a noun, so it should be followed by the preposition "of" instead of "to."

2. "Give" is a verb, so it should be in the present tense "gives" instead of the past tense "give."
Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.

Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".




Prediction:  
1. The comma is missing after "situation."
2. The phrase "particularly for" is redundant. The word "particularly" means "especially," so it is unnecessary to add "for" after it.

Label: 1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.




Prediction:  
1. "Media" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .

Errors:

2. Error: altitudes, Correction: attitudes
3. Error:  , Correction: for
Explanations:
1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.

Prediction:  
1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."

To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown studies, not a singular known study.

But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.

When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in".

The preposition "for" is used to indicate that something is done for the benefit of someone or something else. The preposition "to" is used to indicate that something is done to someone or something else.
Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

3. "Top" is an adjective, so it needs to be followed by a singular noun. "Student" is the correct noun here.
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.

Label: 1. The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so use the plural "groups".

2. The sentence is talking about a specific material, so use the definite article "the".
3. The sentence is talking about a specific material, so use the definite article "the".

4. The sentence is talking about natural disasters in general, so "disaster" should be pluralised.
5. The sentence is talking about natural disasters in general, so "disaster" should be pluralised.
Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.

Label: 1. Auto-correct is a feature that is common to many different electronic devices, so the plural "devices" should be used. The singular "device" is used to refer to individual devices, with "a device" meaning any device and "the device" meaning one specific device.
