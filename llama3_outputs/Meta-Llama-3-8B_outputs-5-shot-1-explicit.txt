Prediction:  
1. The phrase "creative qualified" is redundant. "Creative" implies a person who is highly skilled in their field and therefore "qualified" is unnecessary. 
2. "Resource" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle. 




Prediction:  
1. "The other side" is used to refer to the opposite side of something, so in this case it would be the opposite side of the person doing the genetic testing. "The other hand" is used to refer to the opposite hand of something, so in this case it would be the opposite hand of the person doing the genetic testing.
2. "Want" is used in the present tense, so you should use "wants" instead.
Erroneous sentence: Genetic testing can also be done in the hospitals .
Correct sentence: Genetic testing can also be done in hospitals .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction: 
2. Error: in, Correction: 
Explanations:
1. "Genetic testing" is a singular countable noun, so you should not use the indefinite article "a".
2. "Genetic testing" is a singular countable noun, so you should not use the preposition "in".
Erroneous sentence: In addition , the genetic testing can also be done in the hospitals .
Correct sentence: In addition , the genetic testing can also be done in hospitals .
Errors:
1. Error: in, Correction: 
Explanations:
1. "Genetic testing" is a singular countable
Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Prediction:  
1. This sentence is talking about more than one disadvantage, so use "disadvantages".
2. This is a subject-verb disagreement. "People" is plural, so use the plural verb "concern".
3. The preposition "in" is used to talk about an interest in something, so use "in" here.
Erroneous sentence: However , there is no doubt that people will get more opportunities to know more people with different background and cultures .
Correct sentence: However , there is no doubt that people will get more opportunities to know more people with different backgrounds and cultures .
Errors:
1. Error: background, Correction: backgrounds
2. Error: cultures, Correction: culture
Explanations:
1. The noun "background" is uncountable, so it should be made plural, "backgrounds".
2. The noun "culture" is uncountable, so it should be made plural, "culture".
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.




Prediction:  
1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.
Erroneous sentence: However , as the technology is more and more popular , the potential risk would be more and more serious , the family member would be more and more scared of this certain issue .
Correct sentence: However , as the technology is more and more popular , the potential risk would be more and more serious , the family member would be more and more scared of this certain issue .
Errors:
1. Error: more and more, Correction: more and more
Explanations:
1. "More and more" is an idiomatic phrase, which means that something is increasing. In this sentence, the author is talking about the risk of RFID becoming more and more serious. 
Erroneous sentence: Moreover , the technology has the potential to create a "big brother" society , where people are constantly monitored and tracked .
Correct sentence: Moreover , the technology has the potential to create a "big brother" society , where people
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 




Prediction:  1. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the purpose or reason for which something is done.
Erroneous sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Correct sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .

Erroneous sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Correct sentence: However , there is news about the social media sites leaks users ' information to companies for cash reimbursement .
Errors:
1. Error: with, Correction: for
Ex
Label: 1. The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.




Prediction:  1. "Research" is the singular noun, not the plural. 2. "Show" is a verb, not a noun.
Erroneous sentence: However , this does not mean that the process of writing an essay is not important .
Correct sentence: However , this does not mean that the process of writing an essay is not important .
Errors:
1. Error: However, Correction: However
Explanations:
1. "However" is a conjuction, not a sentence.
Erroneous sentence: The most important thing is that the students have a good command of the English language and that they know how to use it well .
Correct sentence: The most important thing is that the students have a good command of the English language and know how to use it well .
Errors:
1. Error: that, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. "That" is a relative pronoun, and it should be deleted in this sentence.
Erroneous sentence: The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good idea about what you are writing about .
Correct sentence: The first thing you need to do is to make sure you have a good idea about what you are writing about .
Errors:
1. Error: that
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Prediction:  
1. "Reason" is a singular noun, and therefore should be followed by "for" instead of "of".
2. "Halt" is a singular noun, and therefore should be followed by "the" instead of "a".
3. "Work" is a singular noun, and therefore should be followed by "the" instead of "a".
4. "Authorities" is a plural noun, and therefore should be followed by "for" instead of "of".
Erroneous sentence: The fact that the number of the people who have been suffering from the hunger and the poverty in the world has been increased year by year is very shocking .

6. Error:  , Correction:  
Explanations:
1. "People" is a plural noun, and therefore should not have an article.
2. "Number" is a singular noun, and therefore should
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.




Prediction:  
1. The word "police" is singular and is used to refer to a group of people, so it should not be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: For example , the news about the missing child was spread by the family member and friends of the missing child on social media sites .
Correct sentence: For example , the news about the missing child was spread by the family members and friends of the missing child on social media sites .
Errors:
1. Error: member, Correction: members
2. Error: missing child, Correction: missing children
Explanations:
1. "Member" is the singular form of "members". In the sentence, the subject is "family", which is plural, so the correct word is "members".
2. "Missing child" is a singular noun, so the correct expression is "missing children".
Erroneous sentence: Therefore , it is a must for the government to educate the public about the dangers of spreading hoaxes .
Correct sentence: Therefore , it is necessary for the government to educate the public about the dangers of spreading hoaxes .
Errors:
1. Error: a must, Correction: necessary
Explanations:
1. "A must" is an informal way of saying "necessary". This is
Label: 1. "Police" is a collective noun, i.e. it is written as the singular "police", but refers to a group of people, therefore you need to remove the "s".




Prediction: 
Label: 1. The subject is "he/she," which is singular, so the verb should be singular for subject-verb agreement.




Prediction:  
1. The phrase "rely on" is a common expression and the preposition does not change. The preposition "on" means to depend on someone or something.
2. The plural "parents" is used because the sentence is referring to both parents together.
Erroneous sentence: The teenager will be able to get their parents to know about the problem and get help from the parents .
Correct sentence: The teenager will be able to get their parents to know about the problem and get help from the parents .
Errors:
1. Error: about, Correction: on
Explanations:
1. The preposition "on" is used to refer to the act of getting help from someone. The preposition "about" is used to refer to the act of informing someone of a problem.
Erroneous sentence: Parents may not be able to understand the problem of their children .
Correct sentence: Parents may not be able to understand the problem of their children .
Errors:
1. Error: understand, Correction: understand
Explanations:
1. The verb "understand" is used in the passive voice, so it takes the past participle form.
Erroneous sentence: The parents may not understand the problem of their children .
Correct sentence: The
Label: 1. Missing word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. This sentence is either referring to the parents of specific children, or parents and children in general, but either way, "parents" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  
1. Incorrect use of the definite article. A "nutshell" is a metaphor for a small container, so it is a general concept, not a specific one. Therefore, it should be "a" instead of "the".
Erroneous sentence: However , it is still debatable whether people should tell their relatives about the genetic testing result or not .
Correct sentence: However , it is still debatable whether people should tell their relatives about the genetic testing result or not .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: the
Explanations:
1. Missing article. As you are talking specifically about the genetic testing result, use the definite article, "the".
Erroneous sentence: Although it is a very personal information , it is also a very important information to know about .
Correct sentence: Although it is a very personal information , it is also very important information to know about .
Errors:
1. Error: to, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. Incorrect use of "to". The word "to" is a preposition, which is used to indicate a direction. In the context of the sentence, it is more appropriate to use "about" to indicate the topic of the information.
Erroneous sentence: In the future
Label: 1. "In a nutshell" is an idiom, and the article does not change. The phrase "in the nutshell" is not used, but the specificity of "the" makes it sound literal. Instead of referring figuratively to something very simple, it would mean something that is literally inside a nutshell.




Prediction:  
1. The word "about" is used to indicate that you are going to talk about something in a general way. The sentence already uses "using social media" to describe the general concept of the topic, so it is not necessary to use "about" as well.
2. The word "life" is uncountable, so it does not take the plural article "lives." If you want to talk about the lives of multiple people, you can say "the lives of people" or "people's lives."
Erroneous sentence: The main reason why people use social media is to keep in touch with friends and families .
Correct sentence: The main reason people use social media is to keep in touch with friends and family .
Errors:
1. Error: and, Correction:  
2. Error: families, Correction: family
Explanations:
1. The word "and" is used to separate two things that are related to each other. In this case, "friends" and "families" are not two separate things but rather two different groups of people that are related to each other, so it is more appropriate to use "and family" instead of "and families."
2. The word "families" is plural, so it
Label: 1. "Discuss" does not need to be followed by a preposition.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  1. The verb "connect" is used when two or more things are joined together. "Connect" is the present tense form of the verb, so the correct expression is "connects."
Erroneous sentence: For example , the government of China has a huge influence on the economy of China .
Correct sentence: For example , the government of China has a huge influence on the economy of China .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The subject is "the government of China," which is singular, so the verb should be singular too. "Has" is the present tense form of "have," so the correct expression is "has."
Erroneous sentence: The people in the 21st century are living in the digital world , in which the internet is the main source of information .
Correct sentence: The people in the 21st century are living in the digital world , in which the internet is the main source of information .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction:  
Explanations:
1. "The internet" is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Prediction:  
1. "Social media" is singular, so it does not need an article.
2. "In contact" is a fixed expression, so it is not possible to replace "in" with "with".
Erroneous sentence: Although we can get a lot of friends through social media , we also can get a lot of troubles through it .
Correct sentence: Although we can get a lot of friends through social media , we also can get a lot of trouble through it .
Errors:
1. Error: troubles, Correction: trouble
Explanations:
1. The singular noun "trouble" is more appropriate in this context.
Erroneous sentence: In conclusion , social media can help us to get a lot of friends and knowledge , but also can cause a lot of troubles to us .
Correct sentence: In conclusion , social media can help us to get a lot of friends and knowledge , but also can cause a lot of trouble to us .
Errors:
1. Error: troubles, Correction: trouble
2. Error: can, Correction: may
Explanations:
1. The singular noun "trouble" is more appropriate in this context.
2. The word "can" is used to talk about ability, but the word "may" is
Label: 1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. Missing word. The correct expression is "get in contact".




Prediction:  1. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: There are many websites that are dedicated to the sale of products and services , and many of them are also dedicated to the promotion of a specific brand or product .
Correct sentence: There are many websites that are dedicated to the sale of products and services , and many of them are also dedicated to the promotion of a specific brand or product .
Errors:
1. Error: promotion, Correction: promotions
Explanations: 1. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: The social media is a platform for people to communicate and share their ideas , thoughts , and experiences .
Correct sentence: The social media is a platform for people to communicate and share their ideas , thoughts , and experiences .
Errors:
1. Error: experiences, Correction: experience
Explanations: 1. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: There are many websites that are dedicated to the sale of products and services , and many of them are also dedicated to the promotion of a specific brand or product .
Correct sentence: There are many websites that are dedicated to the sale
Label: 1. The sentence is discussing add-ons in general, so "add-on" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  
1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.
2. The verb "use" is intransitive, so it does not take an object. In this case, the correct verb is "use on", which is transitive.
3. The preposition "on" is used when referring to the surface of something. The preposition "over" is used when referring to the power of something.
4. The preposition "on" is used when referring to the surface of something. The preposition "over" is used when referring to the power of something.
Erroneous sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .
Correct sentence: However , the more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: the
2. Error: over, Correction: over
Explanations:
1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the
Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.




Prediction:  
1. "Their" refers to the parents, so it should be replaced with the definite article "the".
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific right that anyone is entitled to, not just the parents discussed in the sentence, so it should be "the right", not "their right".




Prediction: 
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "believe."




Prediction:  1. The phrase "from making" is a collocation, and "to make" is not used. The preposition "from" can indicate the source of something. This sentence is explaining that engineers are discouraged from making more effort to do research and design. 2. The phrase "and" is a conjunction that can be used to join two clauses. This sentence is stating that engineers are discouraged from making more effort to do research and design, and that they have little motivation to work hard. 3. The phrase "will have" is used to indicate that something will happen in the future. This sentence is explaining that engineers are discouraged from making more effort to do research and design, and that they have little motivation to work hard. Therefore, "will have" should be removed.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , the costs of the construction of the new railway station and the subway line are high .
Correct sentence: In addition , the costs of the construction of the new railway station and the subway line are also high .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: also
Explanations:
1. The phrase "also" is used to indicate that something is true as well as something else. This sentence is explaining that the costs of the
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."




Prediction:  
1. The word "other" is singular, so it does not take the plural possessive "other's." Also, the possessive "other's" is used to indicate that something belongs to someone, but "permission" is not a thing that can be owned. 
2. "This" is a pronoun that refers to something that is previously mentioned in the sentence. In this case, "this" refers to the technology being discussed in the sentence, which is "implants and products." 
3. The preposition "in" is used to indicate that something is placed inside something else, while "to" is used to indicate that something is given to someone. In this case, "implants and products" are being placed inside people, not given to them.
Erroneous sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without permission , this technology should not be placed or implanted to anyone .
Correct sentence: We should respect that everyone has human rights and without permission , this technology should not be placed or implanted in anyone .
Errors:
1. Error: to, Correction: in
Explanations:
1. The preposition "in" is used to indicate that something is placed inside something else, while "to" is used
Label: 1. As "permission" is something granted by another person, this is already taken for granted without needing to explicitly say "other's". 
2. You should explicitly state "technology" for clarity.
3. An implant goes inside the body, so you need to use "in" accordingly.




Prediction:  1. The verb "involve" means to include someone in something, so "involve in" is an incorrect phrase. The correct phrase is "involve with," which means to participate in something.
2. "Years" is an uncountable noun that can be used as a unit of time, so it should be pluralised to refer to more than one year. The phrase "one years ago" refers to a year ago, which is not the intended meaning of this sentence. The intended meaning is that the speaker started using Facebook one year ago, so the phrase "one year ago" should be used.
Erroneous sentence: The new york times and other newspaper have also adopted the same practice .
Correct sentence: The New York Times and other newspapers have also adopted the same practice .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: the
2. Error: have, Correction: has
Explanations:
1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "New York Times" from other newspapers, like the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this newspaper is distinct from other ones.
2. The verb "adopt" is singular, so
Label: 1. The phrase "one year" is singular. "One" cannot be used with the plural "years," so it should be the singular "year."




Prediction:  
1. The verb "thought" is in the past tense, so the sentence is saying that the author once thought this, but now has a different opinion. However, the author is still thinking this, so it should be the present tense "think" instead.
Erroneous sentence: People are more and more dependent on the social media to get information about the latest news or events in their lives .
Correct sentence: People are becoming more and more dependent on social media to get information about the latest news or events in their lives .
Errors:
1. Error: are, Correction: becoming
Explanations:
1. This sentence is talking about a change in people's behavior, so it should be the present progressive tense "are becoming" instead of the simple present tense "are."
Erroneous sentence: I think the most important reason why people are so dependent on social media is that , social media is a good way to connect with friends and relatives who are far away .
Correct sentence: I think the most important reason why people are so dependent on social media is that social media is a good way to connect with friends and relatives who are far away .
Errors:
1. Error: ,, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. Unnecessary comma. The position
Label: 1. You are expressing an opinion that you hold now, not something that you thought in the past, so you should use the present tense, "think".




Prediction:  
1. The verb "transfer" is used when something is sent from one place to another. However, the sentence is stating that the information is being sent to the companies, not from one place to another. Therefore, the past participle of "transfer" should be used to convey that the information has already been sent to the companies.
Erroneous sentence: If you want to know how to prevent these hoaxes spreading around , you should be careful about what you share on the social media platform .
Correct sentence: If you want to prevent these hoaxes spreading around , you should be careful about what you share on the social media platform .
Errors:
1. Error: to, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The infinitive "to" is used when stating the purpose of an action. However, the sentence is not stating the purpose of the action, but rather the action itself. Therefore, the infinitive "to" should be removed to convey that the action is preventing hoaxes from spreading.
Erroneous sentence: There are many people who do not know the real meaning of these words , so they tend to use them in the wrong situation .
Correct sentence: There are many people who do not know the real meaning of these words , so they
Label: 1. This is the passive voice, continuing from the phrase "is recorded." The passive voice requires a form of the verb "to be" followed by a secondary verb, which is always the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "transfer" to the past participle "transferred."




Prediction:  
1. "Shwing" is not a word. "Showing" is the correct word.
2. "Experience" is singular, but the sentence is talking about more people, so it should be pluralised to "experiences".
Erroneous sentence: For example , the new technology of 3D printing has been applied to many different fields such as making medical equipments and building houses .
Correct sentence: For example , the new technology of 3D printing has been applied to many different fields such as making medical equipment and building houses .
Errors:
1. Error: equipments, Correction: equipment
2. Error: houses, Correction: house
Explanations: 
1. "Equipment" is singular, but the sentence is talking about many different fields, so it should be pluralised to "equipment".
2. "Houses" is plural, but the sentence is talking about one field, so it should be singular to "house".
Erroneous sentence: The second stage is to gather information . It is the most important stage in the design process .
Correct sentence: The second stage is to gather information . It is the most important stage in the design process .
Errors:
1. Error: It, Correction:  
2. Error: is, Correction
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "showing."
2. The noun "experience" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. It is countable when it refers to events in a person's life and It is uncountable when it refers to work experience or skills or knowledge gained by doing something. intangible things. In the context of sharing photos on social media, it means life events, so it is countable. It should be made plural because the photos show multiple events in the lives of different people.




Prediction:  
1. Incorrect word choice. "More" means "greater in amount or quantity", so it is not used to compare the difficulty of two actions. Instead, "easier" is used.
Erroneous sentence: The doctors and nurses are more likely to get infected by the patients who are more likely to have the virus .
Correct sentence: The doctors and nurses are more likely to get infected by the patients who are more likely to have the virus .
Errors:
1. Error: are, Correction:  
Explanations: 
1. Incorrect word choice. "Are" is used to talk about something that is true in general. The sentence is talking about a specific group of people, so it should be "are".
Erroneous sentence: The most common way for people to find out about the healthiness of their child is to go to the hospital and do genetic testing .
Correct sentence: The most common way for people to find out about the healthiness of their child is to go to the hospital and do genetic testing .
Errors:

1. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is talking about a specific child, so it should be "the child", not "their child".
Erroneous
Label: 1. "More" is never used with "easier" because "easier" already contains the sense of it being "more".




Prediction: 
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Prediction:  1. "Talk with" is a phrasal verb meaning to speak to someone. "Talk to" is a phrasal verb meaning to speak to someone about something.
2. "To" is a preposition that means towards or in the direction of something. "With" is a preposition that means in the company of someone or something. "With" is used to show the relationship between two people, while "to" is used to show the relationship between one person and a destination.
Erroneous sentence: A lot of people have a habit of checking their phones every few minutes , even when they are in a meeting .
Correct sentence: A lot of people have a habit of checking their phones every few minutes , even when they are in a meeting .
Errors:
1. Error: habit, Correction:  
Explanations: 1. "Habit" is an uncountable noun that does not take the indefinite article "a".
Erroneous sentence: The time spent on social media is not only wasted , but also can cause many problems in people's lives .
Correct sentence: The time spent on social media is not only wasted , but also causes many problems in people's lives .
Errors:
1. Error: can, Correction:
Label: 1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.




Prediction:  
1. The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook .
Correct sentence: In addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her and just communicate with friends on facebook .
Errors:
1. Error: but, Correction: and
Explanations:
1. "But" should be used in the situation where you do one thing, but not the other, so you could say, "they don't speak to the people around them, but do communicate with friends on Facebook," but in the context of your sentence, you are saying that both these actions are going on at the same time, so you should use "and", as in they shun/ignore the people around them AND only communicate with friends on Facebook.
Erroneous sentence: The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .
Correct sentence: The earlier we tell them , the better habit they will arise and better
Label: 1. The subject of the statement is "that," which is singular, so the noun that describes it should be singular as well.




Prediction:  
1. The verb "to happen" is always in the third person singular, "happens." The phrase "this happens" is a set phrase, meaning "this is something that occurs." The phrase "this is happening" is a set phrase meaning "this is something that is currently occurring."
2. "The" is used only when the thing being referred to is definite. In this case, the thing being referred to is the country that the child was brought to, but this is not definite, because it could be any country. "A" is used to refer to a single thing that is indefinite, so "a country" would be used here.
3. "Country" is singular, but it is referring to a group of countries. Because it is referring to a group, it should be pluralised. 
4. "Country" is singular, but it is referring to a group of countries. Because it is referring to a group, it should be pluralised. 
5. "Back" is used to refer to a specific place, but the place where the child was brought to is not definite. The phrase "where the child has been brought to" refers to the place where the child was brought to, but it is indefinite,
Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.




Prediction:  
1. Incorrect pluralization. "Challenge" is a noun that refers to a difficult task or problem, so it is not pluralized. The plural of "challenge" is "challenges".
Erroneous sentence: So , I think the first thing we need to do is to take a step back and think about the real purpose of genetic testing .
Correct sentence: So , I think the first thing we need to do is to take a step back and think about the real purpose of genetic testing .
Errors:
1. Error: to, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. Incorrect use of preposition. "Think about" is a phrasal verb that takes a direct object, so "to" is not necessary. It is better to omit "to" in this sentence.
Erroneous sentence: We should also pay attention to the fact that the current genetic testing technology is not so accurate and reliable , and thus we need to be cautious when we take the results .
Correct sentence: We should also pay attention to the fact that the current genetic testing technology is not so accurate and reliable , and thus we need to be cautious when we take the results .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. Incorrect use
Label: 1. The pronoun "another" means "one more," so it is singular and cannot be used with the plural "challenges." The singular "challenge" should be used instead.




Prediction:  
1. "Issue" is an uncountable noun, so it is not pluralized. It is a noun that refers to a problem or a dispute. It can be used in the plural form, but only when it refers to different problems or disputes. It is not used in the singular form, so it should be changed to "issues."
2. The phrase "become more popular" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the verb form "have" in the present tense. It is not used with the verb form "has."
3. The phrase "in the first place" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the preposition "in." The phrase "at the first place" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "place" belongs to privacy issues or is an aspect of it.
Erroneous sentence: Nowadays , many people are addicted to the social media websites , such as facebook , twitter and instagram , and they spend much time on it .
Correct sentence: Nowadays , many people are addicted to the social media websites , such as facebook , twitter and instagram , and they spend much time on it .
Errors:
1. Error: are, Correction:  
2. Error: such, Correction:  
Explan
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about privacy issues in general, so "issue" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Privacy issues" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
3. Incorrect word. The correct expression is "in the first place".




Prediction:  
1. The verb "has" is in the present perfect tense, which means that it is used to talk about an action that started in the past and continues into the present. In this sentence, the action of having the gene A is ongoing, so it should be in the present tense. The verb "have" is used to talk about a present action or a current state. It is the correct verb to use in this sentence.
2. The phrase "at high risk of" is a common expression and the verb does not change. The verb "be at risk" means to have a high chance of experiencing a negative outcome.
3. The phrase "at high risk of" is a common expression and the verb does not change. The verb "be at risk" means to have a high chance of experiencing a negative outcome.
4. "Run" is a verb that means to move or go quickly. The past tense of the verb "run" is "ran." The verb "run" is often used as an intransitive verb, which means it does not take a direct object. In this sentence, "run" is being used as an intransitive verb. The past tense of the verb "run" as an intransitive verb is
Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
3. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.
4. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "running" because the final consonant is doubled when the verb ends with a vowel followed by a consonant.




Prediction:  
1. "Generation" is a noun that requires an article before it.
Erroneous sentence: This is because when people are in the social media , they tend to compare their life with others .
Correct sentence: This is because when people are in the social media , they tend to compare their lives with others ' lives .
Errors:
1. Error: life, Correction: lives
2. Error:  , Correction: 's
Explanations:
1. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
2. "Lives" is plural, so you need to use the possessive form of "other", which is "others'".
Label: 1. Missing article. As you are talking specifically about the next generation, use the definite article, "the".




Prediction:  
1. The concept of "people" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of people instead of to people in general.
Erroneous sentence: In this case , the doctor should be able to provide the patient with a high quality service .
Correct sentence: In this case , the doctor should be able to provide the patient with a high-quality service .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: high-quality
Explanations:
1. The adjective "high quality" is a compound adjective, and "high-quality" is the correct form.
Erroneous sentence: It is not only the government that has the responsibility to help the people , but also the company .
Correct sentence: It is not only the government that has the responsibility to help the people , but also companies .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error:  , Correction: companies
Explanations:
1. The concept of "companies" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific companies instead of to companies in general.
2. The plural form of the word "company" is "
Label: 1. The concept of "people" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of people instead of to people in general.




Prediction:  
1. "Shall" is an archaic and rarely used word that implies a command or obligation. It is not appropriate for a personal statement. Instead, use the more common word "should," which is used to express an opinion or recommendation.
2. The preposition "for" is used to describe the purpose or reason for something. In this case, "for the public" means "for the purpose of the public," which is not the intended meaning. The preposition "to" is used to describe the recipient or destination of something. In this case, "to the public" means "to the people in the public," which is the intended meaning.
3. The word "and" is used to connect two things that are similar or related. In this case, the two things are not similar or related, so the word "or" should be used instead.
Erroneous sentence: The problem of the article is that it is too long and there is no clear conclusion to the article .
Correct sentence: The problem with the article is that it is too long and there is no clear conclusion .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: is, Correction: are
Explanations:
1. The concept of
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.




Prediction:  
1. "Corporate" is an adjective that describes the world, so you should use "the".
2. "Network" is a singular noun, so you should use "network".
3. "Spend" is a verb in the present tense, so you should use "spending" to correspond with it.
Erroneous sentence: The purpose of this research is to discover the relationship between social media and face-to-face meeting frequency .
Correct sentence: The purpose of this research is to discover the relationship between social media and face-to-face meeting frequency .
Errors:
1. Error: discover, Correction: discover
2. Error: between, Correction: between
Explanations:
1. "Discover" is a verb in the present tense, so you should use "discover" to correspond with it.
2. "Between" is used to indicate a relationship between two things, so you should use "between" to indicate the relationship between social media and face-to-face meeting frequency.
Erroneous sentence: People with a lot of friends on social media tend to have a smaller face-to-face meeting frequency than people who do not have a lot of friends on social media .
Correct sentence: People with a lot of friends on social media tend to have a smaller face
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."




Prediction:  
1. The phrase "the more of the writing skills" is redundant. The phrase "the more writing skills" already expresses that there are multiple writing skills. The word "of" is redundant and should be removed.
2. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
Erroneous sentence: The average of the writing skills will be reduced when the average of the time used in the social media sites .
Correct sentence: The average of the writing skills will be reduced when the average of the time used on the social media sites .
Errors:
1. Error: of, Correction:  
2. Error: in, Correction: on
Explanations: 
1. The phrase "the average of the writing skills" is redundant. The phrase "the average writing skills" already expresses that there are multiple writing skills. The word "of" is redundant and should be removed.
2. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because
Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here. 




Prediction: 
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. If you were using "in spite" it would be okay to write "in spite of the distance", but "of" is not necessary when using "despite".




Prediction: 
Label: 1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.




Prediction:  
1. The word "morals" is a plural form of the word "moral", which means "a standard of right behavior". It is often used in the plural form to refer to a set of moral principles that guide a person's behavior.
2. Missing article. As you are talking about a specific directive, use the definite article, "the".
Erroneous sentence: These are not the only challenges that the innovators are going to deal with .
Correct sentence: These are not the only challenges that innovators are going to deal with .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of to innovators in general.
Erroneous sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Correct sentence: Thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button .
Errors:
1. Error:
Label: 1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."




Prediction:  
1. The definite article "a" is used to refer to a specific item, while the indefinite article "an" is used to refer to a general or unspecified item. The phrase "birthday wishes" is general and unspecified, so the indefinite article "an" should be used.
Erroneous sentence: When the online social network became popular , people are eager to share their daily life and get connected with other people .
Correct sentence: When the online social network became popular , people were eager to share their daily life and get connected with other people .
Errors:
1. Error: are, Correction: were
Explanations:
1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "were" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the past. Therefore, the past tense "were" should be used.
Erroneous sentence: Social media also allow people to share their daily life , which means that they are able to keep in touch with their friends and family .
Correct sentence: Social media also allow people to share their daily life , which means that they are able to keep in
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "birthday wishes." Either "birthday wishes" or "a birthday wish" would be acceptable.




Prediction:  
1. The phrase "real thought" is incorrect because it is singular. If the author is referring to one thought, then the correct phrase would be "real thought." However, the phrase "real thoughts" is more appropriate because the author is referring to the totality of someone's thoughts. The phrase "real thought" is more appropriate if the author is referring to a specific thought.
2. The phrase "personalities" is incorrect because it is plural. If the author is referring to one personality, then the correct phrase would be "personality." However, the phrase "personalities" is more appropriate because the author is referring to the totality of someone's personality. The phrase "personality" is more appropriate if the author is referring to a specific personality.
Erroneous sentence: The word "cruelty" is an adjective , which is used to describe a noun .
Correct sentence: The word "cruelty" is an adjective , which is used to modify a noun .
Errors:
1. Error: describe, Correction: modify
Explanations:
1. "Describe" is a verb that means to give a detailed account of something. "Modify" is a verb that means to change or adapt something. In this context
Label: 1. The singular noun "thought" refers to a single idea or opinion. For example, "I think I'd like eggs for breakfast" or "She thinks it would be fun to try beekeeping" are two thoughts. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "thoughts" should be pluralized.
2. The singular noun "personality" means a collection of traits, behaviors, or emotional qualities that make up an individual's character. The plural noun "personalities" refers to the personalities of multiple people.




Prediction:  
1. "Life" is singular, and "lives" is plural. The sentence is saying that the lives of people are made more colorful, so it should be "lives".
Erroneous sentence: It is not difficult to notice that people who are addicted to social media have a tendency to lose the interest of face-to-face communication .
Correct sentence: It is not difficult to notice that people who are addicted to social media have a tendency to lose interest in face-to-face communication .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: of, Correction: in
Explanations:
1. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
2. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.
Erroneous sentence: Nowadays , the people have to pay more attention to the social media , which is a good way to interact with
Label: 1. The sentence mentions multiple people, so "life" should be pluralised, as there are multiple lives.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. This sentence is saying that one cannot understand a person "through the means of" stalking their Facebook page, and so you need to use "by" here to express the same meaning. It is being used in the same way as "He came by train".




Prediction:  
1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "The best" means the only possible outcome. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "a best", which implies that the outcome is one of several.
Erroneous sentence: Social media sites have created a new way of communication that is more convenient and easier to use .
Correct sentence: Social media sites have created a new way of communication that is more convenient and easier to use .
Errors:
1. Error: that is, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. Unnecessary word. "That is" is a conjunction that is used to introduce a statement, but the statement is not needed in this sentence.
Erroneous sentence: The social media sites are like a new way of communication which is more convenient and easier to use .
Correct sentence: The social media sites are like a new way of communication which is more convenient and easier to use .
Errors:
1. Error: are, Correction:  
2. Error: which, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. Unnecessary word. The sentence is talking about the social media sites in general, so use the third person singular
Label: 1. The sentence is mentioning one specific decision, i.e., the correct one, so use the definite article, "the".




Prediction:  
1. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.
2. "Relationship" is a singular noun, so it should not be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: When a person is in need of help , the most effective way to seek for help is through social media .
Correct sentence: When a person is in need of help , the most effective way to seek help is through social media .
Errors:
1. Error: for, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The preposition "for" is not necessary in this sentence. "Seek" and "help" are both transitive verbs that require the direct object "help" in this sentence.
Erroneous sentence: In this case , social media has a very high impact to the society because it is very easy to access .
Correct sentence: In this case , social media has a very high impact on the society because it is very easy to access .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: impact, Correction: impacts
Explanations:
1. The concept of "social media
Label: 1. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.
2. When referencing relationships as a general concept, the plural "relationships" should be used because it references multiple relationships between many different people. The singular "relationship" is used to refer to individual relationships, with "a relationship" meaning any relationship and "the relationship" meaning one relationship specifically.




Prediction:  
1. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "as soon as a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile" means that a person becomes aware of his or her genetic profile at one point in time. This sentence is not referring to one point in time, but to a general situation. Therefore, "as soon as" should be replaced with "as soon as."
Erroneous sentence: In addition , the fact that the people are not aware of the risk , and the risk is not going to be revealed to them , is a reason to not tell the family members .
Correct sentence: In addition , the fact that the people are not aware of the risk , and the risk is not going to be revealed to them , is a reason not to tell the family members .
Errors:
1. Error: to, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. "To" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the subject is "the risk" and the verb is "not going to be revealed." The subject and verb are not directed at anything, so "to" should be removed.
Erroneous sentence: Therefore , the genetic risk is not the person 's fault
Label: 1. "Knowledge" is an uncountable and abstract noun, so it cannot be made singular or plural, thus it cannot be used with the indefinite article 'a.'




Prediction: 
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "obvious." Also, it looks like the author intended to use the word "obviously," which is an adverb. Adverbs are used to modify verbs, but in this sentence, the word follows "it is" and therefore should be a noun.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. The subject here is "social media," which is collective and treated as singular, so the verb should be "does" for subject verb agreement.




Prediction:  
1. The phrase "be shy for" is an idiom meaning "to feel shy about something." The word "be" is not a verb in this case, but an auxiliary verb. This is because the verb "to be" can be used as an auxiliary verb in order to form a question. In this case, it is used to indicate that the subject is a noun or pronoun. Therefore, it should be changed to "afraid of" to make the sentence grammatically correct.
Erroneous sentence: Hence, some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
Correct sentence: Hence, some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
Errors:
1. Error: in, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The sentence is confusing two phrases: "keep confidential" and "in confidence." The phrase "keep confidential" is common and is used without variation in wording.
Erroneous sentence: Hence, some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential .
Correct sentence: Hence, some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
Errors:
1. Error: in
Label: 1. The first "be" in the sentence can be used for both "shy" and "afraid", you do not need to repeat it for "afraid".




Prediction:  
1. The sentence should be "and just communicate with friends on facebook" because the sentence is saying that the person communicates with friends on facebook and not the people surrounding him or her.
Erroneous sentence: With the rapid development of technology , people are more and more dependent on technology and forget about the real life .
Correct sentence: With the rapid development of technology , people are more and more dependent on technology and forget about the real life .
Errors:
1. Error: and, Correction:  
2. Error: and, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The sentence should be "forget about the real life" because the sentence is saying that the person forgets about the real life and not the real life that the person forgets about.
2. The sentence should be "forget about the real life" because the sentence is saying that the person forgets about the real life and not the real life that the person forgets about.
Erroneous sentence: The most common reason is that the parents want to know the genetic disease of their children , and if the children have the disease , they can do the genetic testing to know the disease .
Correct sentence: The most common reason is that the parents want to know the genetic disease of their children , and
Label: 1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations. With "and," the sentence means that one might neglect people in order to use Facebook instead, or that one is neglecting people while also using Facebook. The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.

Label: 1. The noun "policy" requires either an article or pluralization. The definite article "the" refers to a specific policy, especially one that was mentioned earlier in the text. Because no such policy was mentioned, it should be changed to the indefinite article "a," which refers to one single unspecified policy out of multiple potential policies, or alternately to the plural "policies," which means multiple unspecified policies.




Prediction:  
1. "In the past decades" is a singular phrase, so it should be followed by the singular "was" instead of the plural "were."
2. "In the past decades" is a singular phrase, so it should be followed by the singular "was" instead of the plural "were."
3. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "connected" implies that people no longer connect with others who live far away, so it should be the present tense "connect" instead.
4. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "lived" implies that people no longer live far away, so it should be the present tense "live" instead.
Erroneous sentence: When the social media sites are fully developed , the people can connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .
Correct sentence: When the social media sites are fully developed , the people can connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter .

Label: 1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.
4. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." It's discussing how people in the past communicated with friends and relatives living far away. Because it is referring to the same time period, the present tense "live" should be changed to the past tense "lived."




Prediction:  1. Incorrect plural. "Genes" is the plural form of "gene", so use it to refer to multiple genes.
Erroneous sentence: However , the most important thing is to have a positive attitude in life .
Correct sentence: However , the most important thing is to have a positive attitude in life .
Errors:
1. Error: to, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. Incorrect preposition. "To" is used to indicate movement towards a destination, so it is not correct to use it with "have" in this sentence.
Erroneous sentence: As we know , the world is changing every day and it is a very fast pace .
Correct sentence: As we know , the world is changing every day at a very fast pace .
Errors:
1. Error: and, Correction:  
2. Error: it, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. Incorrect preposition. "At" is used to indicate movement towards a destination, so it is not correct to use it with "change" in this sentence.
2. Incorrect pronoun. "It" is a third person singular pronoun, so it should only be used to refer to a third person singular subject. The subject of this sentence is "the world",
Label: 1. The technology to alter genetic material could be applied not just to a single gene but any and all genes. For that reason, it's correct to use the plural "genes" rather than the singular "gene."




Prediction:  1. The definite article "the" is used to indicate that something is specific or has already been mentioned. The word "field" refers to a specific field of study, so it takes the definite article "the."
Erroneous sentence: We should do more research to find out what the cause is .
Correct sentence: We should do more research to find out what the causes are .
Errors:
1. Error: is, Correction: are
Explanations:
1. The verb "to be" must agree with the subject in number, so the verb should be "are" for plural subjects.
Erroneous sentence: There are many reasons for the rising number of the crime rate in the society .
Correct sentence: There are many reasons for the rising number of crimes in society .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The word "crime" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific crimes instead of to crimes in general.
2. The word "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to
Label: 1. The concept of "technological advancement" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific advancement instead of the progress of technology in general.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.




Prediction:  
1. "Researches" is a plural noun and does not agree with the singular verb "has been decreasing". The singular noun "research" is the correct choice.
2. The verb "show" is the singular form of the verb "shows" and is used with a singular subject. The verb "shows" is used with a plural subject.
Erroneous sentence: This is the reason why it is very important to be aware of the effects of the use of social media and to keep in mind that we have to make a balance between the use of social media and the real life .
Correct sentence: This is the reason why it is very important to be aware of the effects of the use of social media and to keep in mind that we have to make a balance between the use of social media and real life .
Errors:
1. Error: real, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The adjective "real" is used to describe things that are genuine and authentic. It does not generally require an article. The noun "real life" is used to describe a person's daily life and the experiences they have in it. It does require an article.
Erroneous sentence: The use of social media has a positive effect on the way we communicate
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.




Prediction:  
1. The preposition "for" is used to indicate the purpose for which something is done. In this case, the skill of writing is done for the purpose of expressing feelings and opinions.
Erroneous sentence: It is an important factor for the person who want to be a writer to learn how to write .
Correct sentence: It is an important factor for the person who wants to be a writer to learn how to write .
Errors:
1. Error: want, Correction: wants
Explanations:
1. The subject, "the person," is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."
Erroneous sentence: The world is full of people who are not satisfied with their life , and they are always looking for something to change their life .
Correct sentence: The world is full of people who are not satisfied with their lives , and they are always looking for something to change their lives .
Errors:
1. Error: their, Correction:  
2. Error: their, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The subject, "people," is plural, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the possessive adjective should be "their," not "
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. Use "for" to link what is essential (the skill of writing) with regard to whom (a person).




Prediction:  
1. The phrase "discriminate them" is an awkward and ungrammatical phrase. It should be changed to "discriminate against them" to be grammatical and more idiomatic. The preposition "against" is used to indicate a negative action against someone or something.
Erroneous sentence: As the new generation , we should have the same rights as the old generation .
Correct sentence: As the new generation , we should have the same rights as the old generation .
Errors:
1. Error: , Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The preposition "as" is used to indicate similarity between two things. It should be used in this sentence to indicate that the new generation has the same rights as the old generation.
Erroneous sentence: I am a boy , but I am not a man .
Correct sentence: I am a boy , but I am not a man .
Errors:
1. Error: , Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The preposition "as" is used to indicate similarity between two things. It should be used in this sentence to indicate that the new generation has the same rights as the old generation.
Erroneous sentence: We have to be careful , or we will be in trouble .

Label: 1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."




Prediction:  
1. This sentence is talking about a single result, so should use a singular verb form. Also, there is no need to separate "research result" as they are two words in the same phrase. Therefore, you should use a comma and a space before "products" instead.
2. "System" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.
Erroneous sentence: So it is clear that people need to spend more time with their family and friends , instead of spending their time on social media sites .
Correct sentence: So it is clear that people need to spend more time with their family and friends instead of spending their time on social media sites .
Errors:
1. Error: , instead of, Correction: instead of
Explanations:
1. Incorrect preposition. Use "instead of" to link what is essential (spending time with family and friends) with what is not (spending time on social media sites).
Erroneous sentence: The first reason is that people spend more time on social media sites , instead of spending their time with their family and friends .
Correct sentence: The first reason is that people spend more time on social media sites instead of spending their time with their family and friends
Label: 1. Use a full stop to separate these two sentences.
2. The sentence is talking about systems in general, so "system" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  
1. "Become" is a verb that is used when the subject is not known, while "becomes" is a verb that is used when the subject is known. In this case, the subject of "becomes" is "expressing themselves appropriately," which is known to be a problem.
Erroneous sentence: The social media sites may be a good way of communication for people , but the social media sites can also cause some negative impacts for people .
Correct sentence: The social media sites may be a good way of communication for people , but the social media sites can also cause some negative impacts on people .
Errors:
1. Error: for, Correction: on
Explanations:
1. "On" is used to describe the effect of the social media sites on people, while "for" is used to describe the purpose of the social media sites.
Erroneous sentence: The social media sites can cause some negative impacts for the people in the society .
Correct sentence: The social media sites can cause some negative impacts on the people in the society .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The concept of "people" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. "Expressing themselves" is the third person singular, so use "becomes" to correspond with it.




Prediction:  
1. Incorrect preposition. The word "internet" is a general concept, and as such, it should be preceded by the definite article "the".
Erroneous sentence: The internet has been a useful tool for many people to find their friends and relatives .
Correct sentence: The internet has been a useful tool for many people to find their friends and relatives .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction:  
Explanations: 
1. Incorrect word choice. The word "tool" is used to refer to a specific thing that is used for a particular purpose, not a general concept. In this sentence, the internet is being used to find friends and relatives, so it is a tool. It should be preceded by the definite article "the".
Erroneous sentence: The internet has been a useful tool for many people to find their friends and relatives .
Correct sentence: The internet has been a useful tool for many people to find their friends and relatives .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction:  
Explanations: 
1. Incorrect word choice. The word "tool" is used to refer to a specific thing that is used for a particular purpose, not a general concept. In this sentence, the internet is being used to find friends
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Prediction:  
1. The sentence is saying that people interact with "each other", not "each others".
2. The word "aspect" means a part of something or a particular feature. It is usually used with plural nouns. It is more logical to say that human interaction plays an important role in our life, as it is an important part of our lives.
Erroneous sentence: The reason why it is so popular is because of the fact that it is free and it is easy to use .
Correct sentence: The reason why it is so popular is because it is free and it is easy to use .
Errors:
1. Error: because of the fact that, Correction: because
Explanations:
1. "Because of the fact that" is redundant and can be replaced with just "because".
Erroneous sentence: This is a very useful website for people who want to find information about their family history , and they can also get to know their family members .
Correct sentence: This is a very useful website for people who want to find information about their family history , and they can also get to know their family members .
Errors:
1. Error: and, Correction: 
Explanations:
1. "And" is redundant and can be deleted.
Err
Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".




Prediction: 
Label: 1. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society, instead of the concept in general.




Prediction:  
1. Forest'view is not a valid word, as the apostrophe is in the wrong place. The apostrophe is used to show that the letter "s" is missing, so the correct word is "Forest's view".
Erroneous sentence: In addition , the governments should pay more attention to the development of this technology .
Correct sentence: In addition , the government should pay more attention to the development of this technology .
Errors:
1. Error: governments, Correction: government
Explanations:
1. The sentence is talking about one government, so the singular "government" is correct.
Erroneous sentence: For example , if a person has a disease that is hereditary , he or she should tell his or her family member about the disease and the risk .
Correct sentence: For example , if a person has a disease that is hereditary , he or she should tell his or her family members about the disease and the risk .
Errors:
1. Error: family member, Correction: family members
Explanations:
1. The word "member" refers to a single person, so "members" is the correct word here.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , people should have the right to decide whether they want to know their genetic
Label: 1. An "s" and a space are missing. There should be an "s" after the apostrophe and "view" should be a separate word.




Prediction:  1. The word "length" is singular, and "great lengths" is a phrase that means "to a great extent." Therefore, the plural "lengths" is correct.
2. The word "short" is an adjective, and the word "shorter" is an adverb. Therefore, the word "shorter" is incorrect. The sentence should say "as short as they can."
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".




Prediction:  1. Incorrect word choice. "Diagnosis" is the medical term for determining the cause of a disease or illness. 2. "Seconly" is an incorrect spelling of "Secondly".
Erroneous sentence: When a carrier gets married , he should tell his spouse that he is a carrier and his spouse has a 50% chance to be a carrier .
Correct sentence: When a carrier gets married , he should tell his spouse that he is a carrier and his spouse has a 50% chance of being a carrier .
Errors:
1. Error: he is a carrier, Correction: he is a carrier
2. Error: his spouse has a 50% chance to be a carrier, Correction: his spouse has a 50% chance of being a carrier
Explanations: 1. Incorrect word choice. The word "is" is used when the subject is the same as the verb. The word "has" is used when the subject is different from the verb. 2. Incorrect word choice. "Chance of" is used when the subject is different from the verb.
Erroneous sentence: I think it is also important to know that we can also use the information to help us to avoid the disease .
Correct sentence
Label: 1. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "diagnosis".
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "Secondly".




Prediction:  
1. The phrase "a discovery under an accidental case" is awkward and unclear. "A discovery" implies that it is a single discovery, while "under an accidental case" implies that it is a discovery made under a certain circumstance. "The phenomenon of making an unintentional discovery" is a more accurate description of serendipity.
2. The phrase "results the invention of a new technology" is awkward and unclear. "Results in" is a more common phrase used to indicate the outcome of something.
Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.




Prediction:  
1. The phrase "a better habit" is not commonly used. The phrase "the better habit" is more common and sounds more natural. 
Erroneous sentence: The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .
Correct sentence: The earlier we tell them , the better habit they will arise and the better for the rest of their lives .
Errors:
1. Error: a, Correction: the
2. Error: better, Correction: the
Explanations:
1. The phrase "a better habit" is not commonly used. The phrase "the better habit" is more common and sounds more natural. 
2. The phrase "better for the rest of their lives" is not commonly used. The phrase "the better for the rest of their lives" is more common and sounds more natural. 
Erroneous sentence: The earlier we tell them , a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives .
Correct sentence: The earlier we tell them , the better habit they will arise and the better for the rest of their lives .
Errors:
1. Error: a, Correction: the
2. Error: better, Correction: the
Explanations:
1.
Label: 1. The construction "the earlier A, the better B" is talking about specifics, with a greater focus on B. As such, B requires an article, and as you are talking about something specific, you should use the definite article, "the".




Prediction:  1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "a result." The word "result" is a noun, and it should not have the definite article "the" before it.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , the person who has genetic testing can know more about the disease , including the treatment and prevention .
Correct sentence: In addition , the person who has genetic testing can know more about the disease , including its treatment and prevention .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction: its
Explanations:
1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "its." The word "its" is a possessive pronoun and is used to refer to a noun that has already been mentioned. In this case, the noun is "disease," so the possessive pronoun should be "its."
Erroneous sentence: In the other hand , the person who has genetic testing will be under a lots of pressure , because they are the first one in their family to have genetic testing .
Correct sentence: In the other hand , the person who has genetic testing will be under a lots of pressure , because they are the first one in their family to have genetic testing .
Errors:
1. Error: hand, Correction: hand

Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to one specific thing and the indefinite article "a" to an unspecified thing, or one option out of many. "As the result" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a result," which implies that the outcome is one of several.




Prediction:  
1. The noun "supports" is a plural noun, so the verb "must" needs to be pluralized as "musts." In this case, however, the noun is singular, so the verb "must" is correct.
Erroneous sentence: As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .
Correct sentence: As a result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed .

Label: 1. In the context of care and aid from other people, the word "support" is an uncountable noun and is not pluralized. It generally refers to actions or gestures, which are not tangible and cannot be counted. The word "supports" is a verb form or a noun referring to the structural components of a building that allow it to withstand force.




Prediction:  
1. Incorrect form. "Research" is a singular noun and therefore requires a singular verb, so "has been proven" should be replaced with "is proven".
2. Incorrect form. "Users" is a plural noun and therefore requires a plural verb, so "feel" should be replaced with "feel".
3. Incorrect form. "Users" is a plural noun and therefore requires a plural verb, so "feel" should be replaced with "feel".

2. Incorrect form. "Innovators" is a plural noun and therefore requires a plural verb, so "is working
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. This sentence is talking about users in general and therefore should not have an article.
3. "Facebook" is a proper noun and therefore should not have an article.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. As "risk" is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".

Erroneous sentence: In addition , they can also use the internet to access the social media .
Correct sentence: In addition , they can also use the internet to access social media .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The
Label: 1. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing computers as a general concept, the plural "computers" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "computer" is used to refer to an individual computer, with "a computer" meaning any computer and "the computer" meaning one computer specifically.
2. The plural noun "devices" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing laptops as a general concept, the plural "laptops" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "laptop" is used to refer to an individual laptop, with "a laptop" meaning any laptop and "the laptop" meaning one laptop specifically.
3. The plural noun "tablet" is followed by a list, so that list should also be plural. Also, when referencing tablets as a general concept, the plural "tablets" should be used because it references multiple types. The singular "tablet" is used to refer to an individual tablet, with "a tablet" meaning any tablet and "the tablet" meaning one tablet specifically.
4. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.
5. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "did" implies that the phone is no longer involved in people's work, so it should be the present tense "do" instead.




Prediction:  1. The first error is a comma splice. A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are joined with only a comma. This error is often seen in sentences where the writer is attempting to connect two ideas that are related but not closely related enough to use a conjunction. In this sentence, the writer is attempting to connect the two ideas "another problem" and "the benefits from investing." Because these two ideas are not closely related, a comma splice should not be used. Instead, the writer should use a semicolon to connect the two ideas or add a conjunction to create a more complete sentence.
2. The word "reflected" is used as a verb in this sentence, but the word "reflected" is not a verb. The word "reflected" is an adjective, and it should be used as an adjective.

The word "reflected" is not a verb, and it should be used as an adjective. The word "reflected" is not a verb, and it should be used as an adjective. The word "reflected" is
Label: 1. Unnecessary comma. The position of the comma is grammatically incorrect.
2. Incorrect spelling. The correct spelling is "reflected".




Prediction: 
Label: 1. If you "agree on" something it usually means you reach a compromise with someone. When talking about an opinion and saying whether you agree or disagree, "agree" is usually followed by the preposition "with".
2. Incorrect word choice. This is an opinion/assertion that is being stated, so use "statement".




Prediction:  1. "With the existence of social media sites" is a common phrase. The word "with" is not needed. 2. The subject is "the existence of social media sites," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "has" for subject-verb agreement.
Erroneous sentence: Besides , social media sites could be the main reason for the increase in the number of people who have depression .
Correct sentence: Besides , social media sites could be a main reason for the increase in the number of people who have depression .

1. The phrase "a main reason" implies that there are other reasons, so the definite article "the" is not needed. 2. "Who" is used to refer to people, while "that" is used to refer to things. The phrase "people who have depression" refers to people, so "who" is the correct word to use.
Erroneous sentence: In other words , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family .
Correct sentence: In other words , the carrier might not want to be a burden in her family .
Errors:

Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".




Prediction:  1. The preposition "on" is used to indicate that something is dependent on something else. The phrase "the frequent usage and reliance" already implies that social media and the Internet are being used and relied on, so it doesn't need to be repeated. The preposition "on" is more appropriate here because it shows the relationship between social media and the Internet and the society that uses them.
2. The concept of "cyber society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society instead of the concept of cyber society in general.
Erroneous sentence: The social media sites are the most effective tool to make the people connected with each other .
Correct sentence: The social media sites are the most effective tool to make people connected with each other .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
2. Error: make, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The concept of "social media sites" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific site instead of social media sites in general.
2. The verb "make" is used to create something, while the
Label: 1. Incorrect word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on".
2. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. Missing word. Use "with" to link "provides" and "a way of talking and chatting" so we know what is being provided by social media.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general and therefore should not have an article.




Prediction:  
1. "Need" is a noun, and "need" is the only form of the word that takes the indefinite article. "There is need" is a common mistake that is often made by non-native speakers.
Erroneous sentence: The primary reason is that social media is the primary source of information for the public .
Correct sentence: The primary reason is that social media is a primary source of information for the public .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction: a
Explanations:
1. "Primary" is an adjective, so it needs to be followed by a noun. It cannot be used to modify a preposition, as in "the primary source of information". In this sentence, "social media" is the subject of the sentence, so it needs to be followed by an adjective to describe it. The word "primary" means "first in importance", so it is correct to use "primary source" to mean "first source" or "most important source".
Erroneous sentence: The second reason is that social media provides the opportunity to meet new people and share information with them .
Correct sentence: The second reason is that social media provides the opportunity to meet new people and to share information with them .
Errors:
1. Error
Label: 1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need. There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to the time spent on a specific action, not using screens. The definite article conveys that the time in question was spent on this specific action, not on others.




Prediction:  
1. "Lesser" is used when comparing two or more things. "Less" is used when comparing one thing to a standard or a norm. Since the population in Singapore is being compared to the population in China, "less" should be used.
2. The concept of "population in China" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific population instead of the general concept.
Erroneous sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement .
Correct sentence: Nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to high-velocity technological advancement .

Erroneous sentence: Serendipity is usually defined as a discovery under an accidental case , and it often results the invention of a new technology .
Correct sentence: Serendipity is usually defined as the phenomenon of making an unintention
Label: 1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.




Prediction:  
1. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.
Erroneous sentence: Fourthly , social media sites are the best way to share ideas and opinions with friends and family .

Prediction:  
1. The verb "indicate" requires a preposition "of" after its object. 
2. "Carry" is a verb, so the noun "certain disease" should be changed to the gerund "carrying" to go with "high chance".
Erroneous sentence: It is a great concern for the society as the number of children with autism is increasing .
Correct sentence: It is a great concern for the society as the number of children with autism is increasing .
Errors:
1. Error: as, Correction:  
2. Error: increasing, Correction: is increasing
Explanations: 
1. "As" should not be used as a conjunction in this sentence. The sentence is not comparing two things, so "as" is not appropriate. 
2. "Increasing" is a participle and therefore needs to be changed to the present participle form "is increasing" to go with "the number of children with autism".
Erroneous sentence: The survey found that 78% of the respondents were willing to take the risk of having a child with autism .
Correct sentence: The survey found that 78% of the respondents were willing to take the risk of having a child with autism .
Errors:
1. Error
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.




Prediction:  
1. "Emotional" is an adjective that describes the way someone feels, while "emotinal" is a misspelling of "emotional."
Erroneous sentence: In other words , the carrier would be able to face the reality and accept the fact that they are not going to be cured .
Correct sentence: In other words , the carrier would be able to face the reality and accept the fact that they are not going to be cured .
Errors:
1. Error: fact, Correction: facts
Explanations:
1. The word "fact" refers to something that is known to be true, while the word "facts" refers to multiple things that are known to be true. Since the person is not going to be cured, the phrase "the fact" is not appropriate because it implies that there is only one fact. Therefore, the phrase "the facts" is more appropriate.
Erroneous sentence: If the carrier is able to accept the fact that they are not going to be cured , they would be able to get the support from their family and friends .
Correct sentence: If the carrier is able to accept the fact that they are not going to be cured , they would be able to get the support from their family and friends .

Label: 1. This is a typo. The correct spelling is "emotional."




Prediction:  
1. "With" is used to introduce a person or thing that is doing something. "With" is a preposition, and the noun it introduces should be an object, so it should be singular. "With each others" is a plural object, so it should not be used.
Erroneous sentence: It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
Correct sentence: It provides people with a more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: a
Explanations:

Correct sentence: The potential of using social networking sites for education is very large , and it is a very important and useful tool for teachers to use in their teaching .
Errors:
1. Error: and,
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is used when something exists in an unspecified manner or amount, or to express one out of multiple options. The phrase "convenient contact environment" means one potential environment out of many, with varying degrees of convenience. This condition is best expressed by the indefinite article "a."




Prediction:  
1. Unnecessary word. When talking about something, you would use "about" to indicate that you are talking about it. Since you are talking about social media, you do not need to use "about".
2. As "society" is something general and uncountable, it does not need an article, so remove "the".
Erroneous sentence: There are a lot of people who are addicted to social media , and it is also a great place for people to make friends .
Correct sentence: There are a lot of people who are addicted to social media , and it is also a great place for people to make friends .

1. "Person" is a general concept and is understood by the reader. It does not need an article.
Erroneous sentence: The result of the research is that 70
Label: 1. The adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted.
2. The word "some" means an unspecified amount or a large amount. It is usually used with plural nouns. Also, it is unlikely that there is only one gene that can only be inherited by a specific gender, so logically it is more likely to be the plural.




Prediction:  
1. The verb "say" is in the present tense, so it should be conjugated as "say," not "says."
2. The phrase "support the social media" is incorrect. The word "media" is the plural of "medium," so it should be "media," not "social media." The word "social" is not needed because it is implied that the media is social.
Erroneous sentence: The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Correct sentence: The auto correction software is so effective when using electronic devices until we did not realize the importance of writing .
Errors:
1. Error: device, Correction: devices
2. Error: until, Correction:  
Explanations:

2. The phrase "until we did not realize" is incorrect. The phrase "until we realized" is correct, and it means that the person or people did not realize the importance of writing until

2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general.




Prediction:  
1. The verb "pass" is a transitive verb meaning to cause something to go by or move past something or someone. It is used with an object, so it needs to be the present tense "passes" instead of the past tense "passed."
Erroneous sentence: When we meet someone for the first time , we will judge him or her based on their appearance , their voice , or their facial expression .
Correct sentence: When we meet someone for the first time , we will judge them based on their appearance , their voice , or their facial expression .
Errors:
1. Error: him, Correction: them

Prediction:  1. The preposition "in" should be used when describing a location or space. For example, "I am in the kitchen." "On" should be used to indicate that something is happening on a surface. For example, "The cat is on the table." 2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific social media site, instead of to such sites in general. 3. The singular noun "image" refers to a single picture or photograph. For example, "She is a beautiful image" or "I took a picture of the house". But this sentence is referring to a person's entire appearance, which would be better described as "images". 4. The preposition "in" should be used when describing a location or space. For example, "I am in the kitchen." "On" should be used to indicate that something is happening on a surface. For example, "The cat is on the table." 5. The present tense, "do", is used to express a habitual action or a repeated action. But seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "

3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.




Prediction:  
1. Incorrect conjugation. "The medical treatment technology" is the third person singular, so use "was" to correspond with it.

Prediction:  
1. The present participle "studying" should be used to show that the action of studying is currently still happening. 
2. The preposition "in" should be used to show that the action of studying is currently still happening. 
3. The noun "friend" is singular, so the plural "friends" should be used to correspond with it.

Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.

2. The sentence starts with "He", referring to man, but the third person possessive you have used is the female version. Change to "his" to match with "He" and make it clear that you are talking about a man.




Prediction:  
1. Incorrect preposition. "For" is used when there is a subject and an object. "Seeking out attention" is not a subject and object, but an action and an object. Therefore, "for" is not appropriate here.
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Seek out" does not require the preposition "for" to indicate what is being sought out.




Prediction:  
1. The subject here is the plural "teenagers," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "claim."
Erroneous sentence: They say that social media sites have also become a place for people to talk about their problems .
Correct sentence: They say that social media sites have also become a place for people to talk about their problems .

Errors:
1.
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.




Prediction:  1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need. There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.
2. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need. There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.
3. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
Erroneous sentence: The users are able to use these social media sites to communicate with their friends , family members , and even with their customers or clients .
Correct sentence: The users are able to use these
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "come" to go with "advantages".
2. The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.
3. We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".




Prediction:  
1. The list is talking about things in general, and so "check" should be pluralised to match "annouance" and "medicine".
Erroneous sentence: We can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
Correct sentence: We can not deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The concept of "genetic testing" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific type or instance of genetic testing, instead of the concept in general.
Erroneous sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life .
Correct sentence: However , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring some negative effects on our daily lives .
Errors:
1. Error: in, Correction:  
2. Error: life, Correction: lives
3. Error: effect, Correction: effects
Explanations:
1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings
Label: 1. From the sentence we can surmise that the people would have more than one check, so the plural "checks" should be used.




Prediction:  1. Use the present participle (ending in "-ing") to describe an ongoing action. "Spend" is a past tense verb. 2. Use the definite article "the" to refer to something that is known or has been mentioned before.
Erroneous sentence: However , many people spend too much time on internet and some of them have problems with their health .
Correct sentence: However , many people spend too much time on the internet and some of them have problems with their health .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: the
Explanations:
1. The definite article "the" is used before a noun that refers to something that is known or has been mentioned before. "Internet" is a general term that refers to the entire network of computers, so it should be preceded by the definite article.
Erroneous sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Correct sentence: In conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spending too much time on the internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: the
Explanations:
1. Use the definite article "
Label: 1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.




Prediction:  1. "Engineering" is a proper noun, so it should be capitalised.
2. "Fused" is not a word. The sentence should be reworded to avoid this error.
3. "On" is not a word. The sentence should be reworded to avoid this error.
4. "Deeds" is not a word. The sentence should be reworded to avoid this error.
Erroneous sentence: The engineering design process is an important part of engineering design, and it is the process that engineers use to develop new products or systems .
Correct sentence: The engineering design process is an important part of engineering design, and it is the process that engineers use to develop new products or systems .
Errors:
1. Error: The, Correction:  
Explanations: 1. "The" is not needed here. It is used to indicate a specific process, but it is not needed to indicate that the engineering design process is the one used by engineers.
Erroneous sentence: The process is also known as the engineering design process and is a method of creating new products or systems .
Correct sentence: The process is also known as the engineering design process and is a method of creating new products or systems .
Errors:
1.
Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."




Prediction:  
1. "Get" is a transitive verb that requires an object, so it is incorrect to use "get" without an object. "Put" is an intransitive verb that does not require an object, so it is correct to use "put" without an object.
Erroneous sentence: So ,the question is ,how do we make social media a more positive space for everyone ?
Correct sentence: So , the question is , how do we make social media a more positive space for everyone ?
Errors:

2. Error: , Correction: 
Explanations:
1. The comma is used to separate two independent clauses. However, the two clauses in this sentence are not independent, so the comma is unnecessary.
2. The comma is used to separate two independent clauses. However, the two clauses in this sentence are not independent, so the comma is unnecessary.
Erroneous sentence: Social media has become a place where people are sharing their thoughts and ideas and it is also a place where people are sharing their thoughts and ideas .

Label: 1. The phrase "put in danger" is a common expression and the verb does not change. The verb "put" means to cause someone to be in a particular place or position.




Prediction:  
1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need. There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.

Label: 1. The verb "cause" is always followed by a noun, and "lost" is the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed to the noun "loss." 




Prediction:  
1. "Cause" is a noun that means "the reason for something." It is followed by the preposition "of," as in "the cause of the accident."
2. "Give" is a verb that means "to provide something to someone." It is followed by the direct object "rise," as in "the rise in global temperature."
Erroneous sentence: However , in the modern world , the use of social media has been growing and it has become the most popular way to communicate and express ourselves .
Correct sentence: However , in the modern world , the use of social media has been growing and it has become the most popular way to communicate and express ourselves .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: to
Explanations:
1. "Express" is a verb that means "to communicate." It is followed by the preposition "to," as in "to express oneself."
Erroneous sentence: The first problem is that the data is not being stored in a secure place .
Correct sentence: The first problem is that the data is not being stored in a secure location .
Errors:
1. Error: place, Correction: location
Explanations:
1. "Place" is a noun that means "a particular position in
Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.




Prediction:  
1. The statement is confusing two phrases: "keep confidential" and "in confidence." The phrase "keep confidential" is common and is used without variation in wording.
Erroneous sentence: He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet .
Correct sentence: He can even talk to his daughter face-to-face using video call via the internet .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: the
2. Error: her, Correction: his
Explanations:
1. Missing article. "Internet" is the name of a specific network, so use the definite article, "the".
2. The sentence starts with "He", referring to man, but the third person possessive you have used is the female version. Change to "his" to match with "He" and make it clear that you are talking about a man.
Erroneous sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: on
2. Error: parent, Correction: parents
Explanations:
1. Missing word. This is a phrasal verb, and needs to be completed with "on" to make "rely on
Label: 1. The statement is confusing two phrases: "keep confidential" and "in confidence." The phrase "keep confidential" is common and is used without variation in wording.




Prediction:  
1. The sentence is talking about one specific baby, so use the definite article, "the."
2. "End" is a singular noun, so it should be used with the singular "the."
Erroneous sentence: In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place .
Correct sentence: In addition , privacy issues have become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share in the first place .
Errors:
1. Error: issue, Correction: issues
2. Error: has, Correction: have
3. Error: at, Correction: in
Explanations:
1. This sentence is talking about privacy issues in general, so "issue" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Privacy issues" is the third person plural, so use "have" to correspond with it.
3. Incorrect word. The correct expression is "in the first place".
Erroneous sentence: Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed .
Correct sentence: Parents know what the best is for
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".




Prediction:  
1. This is a punctuation error. The comma should be placed after "situation."
2. This is a word order error. The word "particularly" should be placed before "small children."
3. "Children" is a plural noun and therefore should have a plural verb.
Erroneous sentence: I would like to say that I do not believe that it is a good idea to use the social media to express your opinion to the public .
Correct sentence: I would like to say that I do not believe that it is a good idea to use social media to express your opinion to the public .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
Erroneous sentence: It is a fact that the social media is a very good tool to express your opinion to the public .
Correct sentence: It is a fact that social media is a very good tool to express your opinion to the public .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. "Social media" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
Erroneous sentence: In my opinion , I think that the social
Label: 1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.
2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own.
3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.




Prediction:  
1. The list of design processes should be in parentheses, so there should be a comma before and after the list.
Label: 1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.




Prediction:  
1. "Media" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
Correct sentence: When people around us know that we got a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , whether caring for us too much or keeping away from us .
Errors:
1. Error:  , Correction: a
2. Error: altitudes, Correction: attitudes
3. Error:  , Correction: for
Explanations:
1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.
Erroneous sentence: We should
Label: 1. "Media" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be pluralised.




Prediction:  
1. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
2. When referencing a single instance of contact, it takes the singular "contact." When referencing multiple instances of contact, it takes the plural "contacts."
Erroneous sentence: In the future , I want to be a successful and famous fashion designer , and I want to be a famous person who can design a lot of fashion clothes .
Correct sentence: In the future , I want to be a successful and famous fashion designer , and I want to be a famous person who can design a lot of fashion clothes .
Errors:
1. Error: be, Correction:  
2. Error: be, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The first "be" in the sentence can be used for both "famous" and "designer", you do not need to repeat it for "designer".
2. The first "be" in the sentence can be used for both "famous" and "person", you do not need to repeat it for "person".
Erroneous sentence: This could lead to psychological implications and thus
Label: 1. "Contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an article.
2. When used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.




Prediction:  
1. The indefinite article "a" should be removed because the subject is "research," which is singular and uncountable. The indefinite article "a" is used to refer to one specific example of a countable noun, but "research" is not countable. 
2. The definite article "the" should be removed because "users" is not a specific group of people, and so there is no specific Facebook group of users to refer to. 
3. The definite article "the" should be removed because "lives" is not a specific life. The phrase "other people's lives" is vague and not specific enough to warrant the definite article "the."
Erroneous sentence: There are also some negative impacts of using online social networks . For example , some people may use the social media to make bad things happen .
Correct sentence: There are also some negative impacts of using online social networks . For example , some people may use the social media to make bad things happen .
Errors:
1. Error: some, Correction:  
2. Error: use, Correction: uses
Explanations:
1. "Some" is an indefinite determiner, which refers to a non-specific number of people, and so it should not be used
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.




Prediction:  
1. The conjunction "but" is used to contrast two ideas. In this case, "neglect" is not in contrast to "communicate", but is instead a continuation of the idea. The conjunction "and" should be used instead.
Erroneous sentence: However , the reason for this is that the society is full of people who are not willing to share their own ideas .
Correct sentence: However , the reason for this is that the society is full of people who are not willing to share their own ideas .
Errors:
1. Error: However , Correction:  
2. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. As "However" is used to contrast two ideas, it should be placed at the beginning of the sentence.
2. The concept of "society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific society instead of the general concept.
Erroneous sentence: The internet has also brought many benefits to people , such as socializing , shopping , entertainment and communication .
Correct sentence: The internet has also brought many benefits to people , such as socializing , shopping , entertainment and communication .
Errors:
1. Error: such as,
Label: 1. "But" should be used in the situation where you do one thing, but not the other, so you could say, "they don't speak to the people around them, but do communicate with friends on Facebook," but in the context of your sentence, you are saying that both these actions are going on at the same time, so you should use "and", as in they shun/ignore the people around them AND only communicate with friends on Facebook.




Prediction:  
1. The plural form "dinners" implies that the family has more than one dinner, but this is not the case. The singular form "dinner" implies that the family is having one dinner, which is correct.
Erroneous sentence: The article is talking about the two aspects of the social network , the positive and the negative .
Correct sentence: The article is talking about the two aspects of social network , the positive and the negative .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:
1. The phrase "the social network" refers to a specific thing. The phrase "social network" refers to a general concept. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing, and the indefinite article "a" is used when referring to a general concept. Therefore, "the social network" should be replaced with "social network."
Erroneous sentence: I think that the social network is a good tool for people to communicate with each other , but it can also bring some negative effects to people .
Correct sentence: I think that social network is a good tool for people to communicate with each other , but it can also bring some negative effects to people .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  

Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner. A meal is still referred to in the singular when it is shared by multiple people. Therefore, it should be "having dinner" rather than "having dinners."




Prediction:  
1. The singular noun "dilemma" refers to a situation in which a person must choose between two equally undesirable options. The plural noun "dilemmas" refers to multiple situations in which a person must choose between two equally undesirable options. This sentence is referring to multiple situations, so it should be pluralized.
Erroneous sentence: It is not only the privacy of people , but also the privacy of the companies .
Correct sentence: It is not only the privacy of people , but also the privacy of the companies .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction: 
Explanations:
1. The plural noun "companies" is something general and uncountable, so it does not need an article.
Erroneous sentence: We need to be more aware of what we are doing and how we are doing it .
Correct sentence: We need to be more aware of what we are doing and how we are doing it .
Errors:
1. Error: be, Correction: 
Explanations:
1. This is a double negative. "We need to be more aware" is already a negative statement, so it does not need to be negated again by adding "not" to "are."
Erroneous sentence: We need to be
Label: 1. This is a general statement, referring to many unspecified people. It should be the plural "dilemmas" both because "people" is plural and also because there is a range of potential ethical issues. 




Prediction: 
Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person singular "gives" to go with "wife".




Prediction:  
1. The word "social network" is plural and should therefore be followed by a plural verb.
Erroneous sentence: The concept of social network has been developed to help people to make new friends and find new things to do .
Correct sentence: The concept of social network has been developed to help people make new friends and find new things to do .
Errors:
1. Error: has been, Correction: has
2. Error: to help people, Correction: to help people to
Explanations:
1. Use the present perfect tense to show that the action of developing the concept of social network is currently still happening. To create the perfect present, we use "has" and the past participle "developed."
2. Add "to" before the infinitive verb "help" to create a preposition phrase.
Erroneous sentence: The term "social network" refers to the group of people who have a common interest and share the same activities .
Correct sentence: The term "social network" refers to a group of people who have a common interest and share the same activities .
Errors:
1. Error: The, Correction:  
2. Error: who, Correction: which
Explanations:
1. The concept of "social network
Label: 1. This sentence is talking about social network sites in general, so "site" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  
1. "Times" is the plural form of "time" and should be used in this context. The author is talking about multiple difficult periods in life.
Erroneous sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .
Correct sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Errors:
1. Error: time, Correction: times
Explanations: 
1. "Times" is the plural form of "time" and should be used in this context. The author is talking about multiple difficult periods in life.
Erroneous sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .
Correct sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Errors:
1. Error: time, Correction: times
Explanations: 
1. "Times" is the plural form of "time" and should be used in this context. The author is talking about multiple difficult periods in life.
Erroneous sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time .
Correct sentence: It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times
Label: 1. When generally referring to a period of hardship, time is pluralised, so the correct expression is "the hard times".




Prediction:  
1. The preposition "on" is used to indicate the object of an action. In this sentence, "chatting on the internet" is the object of the action "spend more time." Since "spend more time" is a verb, it cannot have an object, so "on" should be removed.
2. The noun "skill" is singular, so it cannot be used with the plural "will be badly affected." The plural "skills" should be used instead.
Erroneous sentence: The people who use the social media sites are those who are addicted to the internet .
Correct sentence: The people who use the social media sites are those who are addicted to the internet .
Errors:
1. Error: The, Correction:  
2. Error: sites, Correction:  
3. Error: who, Correction:  
Explanations: 
1. The article "the" is used to indicate a specific person or thing. In this sentence, the phrase "people who use the social media sites" is not specific, so the article "the" should be removed.
2. The plural noun "sites" is used with the singular verb "use." Since "use" is singular, it should be changed to the plural "uses
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".
2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
2. The subject is "children," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.




Prediction:  
1. "Causing" is the present participle of the verb "cause." The present participle is used to create a verb phrase that indicates an action that is ongoing. However, this sentence is describing an action that is already completed, so "causing" should be changed to "cause." 
Erroneous sentence: For example , when people use the internet , they could spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face .
Correct sentence: For example , when people use the internet , they could spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face .
Errors:
1. Error: on, Correction:  
2. Error: chatting, Correction: chat
Explanations:
1. Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".
2. This is a spelling error. The verb "chat" is spelled with one "t" at the end.
Erroneous sentence: For example , when people use the internet , they could spend more time
Label: 1. This sentence is not talking about something that is currently happening, but something that could happen, so you need to change the present continuous "causing" to the present "cause".




Prediction:  
1. Unnecessary word. "The" is not needed before "manufacture company" because it is already a specific company, not a general idea.
Erroneous sentence: I agree that RFID technology should not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
Correct sentence: I agree that RFID technology should not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage .
Errors:
1. Error: shall, Correction: should
Explanations:
1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
Erroneous sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Correct sentence: So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Errors:
1. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations: 
1. Unnecessary word. "The" is not needed before "manufact
Label: 1. The concept of "innovators" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of innovators instead of to innovators in general.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."




Prediction:  
1. "On" is used to describe something that is on top of something else. In this case, the newspaper is not on top of anything, but rather a part of the newspaper is on top of something else. Therefore, use "in" instead.
Erroneous sentence: The main reason for the decreasing face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites is that they are more interested in social media sites than real life .
Correct sentence: The main reason for the decreasing face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites is that they are more interested in social media sites than in real life .
Errors:
1. Error: real, Correction: in
Explanations:
1. "Real" is an adjective, so it cannot be used as a noun in this sentence. Instead, use "in" to refer to a noun.
Erroneous sentence: The main reason for the decreasing face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites is that they are more interested in social media sites than real life .
Correct sentence: The main reason for the decreasing face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites is that they are more interested in social media sites than in real life
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".




Prediction: 
Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.

Erroneous sentence: In the 1980s , the first artificial heart was successfully implanted in a human body .

Correct sentence: There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .

Correct sentence: Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is easier than asking people around in real life .

Label: 1. As "society" is something general and uncountable, it does not need an article, so remove "the".




Prediction:

2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. The sentence is talking about people in general, so it does not need an article.




Prediction:  
1. The verb "restrict" means "to limit or prevent something from happening," so it should be used instead of "restric."

Prediction:  
1. "Year" is a noun, so you need to use the preposition "for" after it. 
2. "Student" is a general term, so it needs to be preceded by the definite article "the". 
3. "Top" is a general term, so it needs to be preceded by the definite article "the".
Erroneous sentence: The reason why I think this is because they are not as old as the traditional ones , and they are more convenient for us to use .

Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.




Prediction:  
1. The present perfect tense is used when you want to talk about an action that started in the past and is still happening. This is the case here, since the implants and products are still being used as surveillance tools. Therefore, the verb should be "have been."
Erroneous sentence: The first kind of the internet was the ARPANET .
Correct sentence: The first kind of the internet was the ARPANET .
Errors:
1. Error: of, Correction:  
Explanations:

Prediction:  
1. "In" is an unnecessary preposition. "Bring" is a transitive verb and requires a direct object. "In" is not a direct object.
2. The sentence mentions multiple people, so "life" should be pluralised, as there are multiple lives.
3. "Effect" is a noun that means result. "Effects" is the plural form of "effect".
Erroneous sentence: I think it is a good idea for the company to have a policy to encourage employees to take a rest after working for several hours .
Correct sentence: I think it is a good idea for the company to have a policy to encourage employees to take a rest after working for several hours .
Errors:
1. Error: a, Correction:

Correct sentence: Although many people are against the idea of using social media in education , it is
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "Bring in" means to yield or earn something, as in "His YouTube career brings in $40 million a year", but this is not the sense you want in your sentence, so just use "bring" on its own.
2. This sentence is talking about people's daily lives in general, so "life" should be pluralised.
3. This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  
1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".
Erroneous sentence: These social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
Correct sentence: These social media makes people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .

Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".




Prediction:  
1. Incorrect word choice. "Bond" is a verb, but the sentence is describing a current state, so it should be the noun "bond" instead.
2. Incorrect word choice. The sentence is describing people in general, so it should be "humans" instead of "human".
3. Incorrect word choice. "Lives" is a noun, but the sentence is describing a current state, so it should be the verb "live" instead.
4. Incorrect word choice. "Aids" is a noun, but the sentence is describing a current state, so it should be the noun "aid" instead.
Erroneous sentence: Social media is a good platform for people to connect with each others and sharing their personal information and views on any issues .
Correct sentence: Social media is a good platform for people to connect with each other and share their personal information and views on any issues .
Errors:
1. Error: others, Correction: other

Label: 1. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "bond" to go with "people".
2. This sentence is talking about humans in general, so "human" should be pluralised.

Label: 1. The concept of "genetic testing" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific type or instance of genetic testing, instead of the concept in general.




Prediction:  
1. "Group" is singular and is being used as the subject of the sentence. "Group" is a singular noun, and it is the subject of the sentence, so it should be in the singular form. The sentence is in the plural form because the subject is "family members," which is plural.
2. "Is" is singular and is being used as the subject of the sentence. "Is" is a singular verb, and it is the subject of the sentence, so it should be in the singular form. The sentence is in the plural form because the subject is "family members," which is plural.
Erroneous sentence: The most common example of the use of the Internet is to search for information .
Correct sentence: The most common example of the use of the Internet is searching for information .
Errors:
1. Error: is to, Correction: is

Erroneous sentence: The most common example of the use of the Internet is searching for information .
Correct sentence: The most common example of the use of the Internet is searching for information .
Errors
Label: 1. The sentence is saying that families are one of an unspecified number of groups, so use the plural "groups".
2. This connects back to "family members" at the beginning of the sentence, so you need to use the plural, "are", as in "Family members are a crucial factor...".




Prediction:  
1. "Thousand" is used to refer to a specific number of things, while "thousands" is used to refer to a general number of things. Since "thousands" is a general number of things, it should be used.
2. "Helps" is used to refer to specific instances of help, while "help" is used to refer to general instances of help. Since "help" is a general instance of help, it should be used.
3. "Supports" is used to refer to specific instances of support, while "support" is used to refer to general instances of support. Since "support" is a general instance of support, it should be used.
4. "Needs" is used to refer to specific instances of need, while "need" is used to refer to general instances of need. Since "need" is a general instance of need, it should be used.
Erroneous sentence: In addition , it is very difficult to make a decision about revealing private information because there are different opinions on how to handle it .
Correct sentence: In addition , it is very difficult to make a decision about revealing private information because there are different opinions on how to handle it .
Errors:
1. Error:  ,
Label: 1. This sentence is not using "thousand" as a specific number, i.e. 1,000, it is using it metaphorically to express a large, unspecified amount. In this case, it should be pluralised as "thousands".
2. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
3. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
4. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.




Prediction:  
1. The sentence is not about creating something, it is about using something, so "create" should be "use".
2. There is no need for an article before "material".
3. The subject of the sentence is "material", so you need the definite article.
4. "Despite" means "in spite of", so it is not appropriate here. "During" means "in the course of", which is more appropriate.
5. The sentence is talking about natural disasters in general, so "disaster" should be pluralised.
Erroneous sentence: A new study in 2017 found that the new coronavirus may be able to infect the body through the eyes , which can cause serious eye infections .
Correct sentence: A new study in 2017 found that the new coronavirus may be able to infect the body through the eyes , which can cause serious eye infections .

1. Error: the, Correction:  
Explanations:

Erroneous sentence: If you are in a serious car accident , you should call 911 immediately .
Correct sentence: If you are in a serious car accident , you should call 911 immediately .
Errors:

Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.




Prediction: 
Label: 1. Auto-correct is a feature that is common to many different electronic devices, so the plural "devices" should be used. The singular "device" is used to refer to individual devices, with "a device" meaning any device and "the device" meaning one specific device.
