Prediction:  1. The word qualified is redundant. 2. The word creative is redundant. 3. The word human resource is redundant. 4. The word engineering design processes is redundant. 5. The word for is redundant. 6. The word in is redundant.
cleaned: 1. The word qualified is redundant. 2. The word creative is redundant. 3. The word human resource is redundant. 4. The word engineering design processes is redundant. 5. The word for is redundant. 6. The word in is redundant.
Label: 1. The adjective "qualified" means having the necessary skills to perform a particular task, but it refers mainly to official or certified qualifications, such as tests. There is no test that would certify someone's creative thinking abilities, so "qualified" should be omitted. The sentence could also be reworded to "human resources with creative thinking abilities," but "creative human resources" expresses the same idea more concisely and with less potential for confusion.
2. The phrase "human resources" refers to a group of people who are able to do work. Because it refers to a group, it is only used in the plural in principle. 




Prediction:  1. The word "other" is used to refer to the opposite side of something. In this case, the opposite side of "the other side" is "this side". Therefore, the word "other" is redundant and should be removed. 2. The word "as" is used to introduce a clause that provides additional information about the previous clause. In this case, the previous clause is "On the other side, a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually". The additional information provided by the clause "as stated above" is not relevant to the previous clause and should be removed. 3. The word "above" is used to refer to something that is higher in position or rank. In this case, the word "above" is used to refer to the previous clause, which is not relevant to the current clause and should be removed. 4. The word "person" is used to refer to a single individual. In this case, the word "person" is used to refer to a group of individuals, which is not grammatically correct and should be changed to "people". 5. The word "want" is used to express a desire or wish. In

Label: 1. The phrase "on the other side" is likely understandable, but is not really used in English. The sentence is much easier to understand with the common set phrase idiom "on the other hand."
2. The subject, "a person" is singular, and so for the sake of subject-verb agreement, the verb should be "wants," not "want."




Prediction:  1. The word “that” is missing after “disadvantages”. 2. The word “the” is missing before “interest”. 3. The word “in” is missing before “face-to-face communication”.
cleaned: 1. The word “that” is missing after “disadvantages”. 2. The word “the” is missing before “interest”. 3. The word “in” is missing before “face-to-face communication”.
Label: 1. The noun "disadvantage" requires either pluralization or an article. It refers to a result of something, so it is often plural because it is assumed that any action can cause multiple results. Unless it is known that there is only one singular disadvantage, usually it is used in the plural. Also, the phrase "one of" implies that there are multiple potential members of a group, so what comes after it must be plural.
2. I partially agree with the correction because "the" should be deleted, but that does not fix the issue. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it never uses an article. The first word is always a verb form, and "loss" is a noun, so it should be changed to "lose."
3. The phrase "lose interest in" is a commonly used expression, and it always uses the article "in." The phrase "lose interest of" is incorrect, and it would mean that the "interest" belongs to face-to-face communication or is an aspect of it.




Prediction:  1. The word “shall” is not used in the present tense. It is used in the future tense. 2. The word “made” is not used in the present tense. It is used in the past tense. 3. The word “for” is not used in the present tense. It is used in the future tense. 4. The word “easy” is not used in the present tense. It is used in the future tense. 5. The word “distorted” is not used in the present tense. It is used in the future tense.

The word “distorted” is not used in the present tense. It is used in the future tense.
Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used.

The word 'for' is not needed in the sentence. 17. The word 'cash' is not needed
Label: 1. The phrase "with cash imbursement" means that the social media sites provided companies with both user information and cash reimbursement. The preposition "for" can mean in exchange, so "for cash reimbursement" means that companies paid social media sites in order to receive user information.




Prediction:  1. The word “researches” is plural, but the verb “show” is singular. 2. The word “that” is unnecessary. 3. The word “frequency” is singular, but the verb “has been decreasing” is plural. 4. The word “people” is plural, but the verb “has been decreasing” is singular.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Erroneous sentence: Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Correct sentence: Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
Explanations: 1. The word “researches” is plural, but the verb “show” is singular. 2. The word “that” is unnecessary. 3. The word “frequency” is singular, but the verb “has been decreasing” is plural. 4. The word “people” is plural, but the verb “has been decreasing” is singular.
cleaned: 1. The word “researches” is plural, but the verb “show” is singular. 2. The word “that” is unnecessary. 3. The word “frequency” is singular, but the verb “has been decreasing” is plural. 4. The word “people” is plural, but the verb “has been decreasing” is singular.
Label: 1. "Researches" is the third person singular verb form, as in "He/she researches social media use". Based on the context of this sentence, you are most likely talking about research as a noun, and it does not need to be pluralised as it is an uncountable noun, so just use "research".
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Research" is treated as the third person singular, so use "shows" to correspond with it.




Prediction:  1. The word “reason” is a noun, so it should be “reason for” instead of “reason of”. 2. The word “halt” is a verb, so it should be “halt of” instead of “halt of”. 3. The word “work” is a noun, so it should be “work was” instead of “work was”. 4. The word “thought” is a verb, so it should be “thought an underground traffic system was” instead of “thought an underground traffic system was”. 5. The word “necessary” is an adjective, so it should be “necessary for” instead of “necessary for”. 6. The word “Harbin” is a noun, so it should be “Harbin” instead of “Harbin”.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.Erroneous sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
Correct sentence: Some evidences showed that the reason for the halt of the work was that the higher level authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .

cleaned: 1. The word “reason” is a noun, so it should be “reason for” instead of “reason of”. 2. The word “halt” is a verb, so it should be “halt of” instead of “halt of”. 3. The word “work” is a noun, so it should be “work was” instead of “work was”. 4. The word “thought” is a verb, so it should be “thought an underground traffic system was” instead of “thought an underground traffic system was”. 5. The word “necessary” is an adjective, so it should be “necessary for” instead of “necessary for”. 6. The word “Harbin” is a noun, so it should be “Harbin” instead of “Harbin”.
Label: 1. The phrase "the reason for" is a collocation, and "that the reason of" is not used. The preposition "for" can indicate why something is done. This sentence is explaining the reason that work stopped, so "for" is used to indicate that the cause of the stoppage was that the authorities thought a traffic system was not necessary.
2. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific instance of an action. This sentence is referring to a specific incident where work was stopped on a specific engineering project, so the definite article is necessary.
3. The definite article "the" is used when referring to a specific thing. This sentence is referring to a specific engineering project where work was stopped, so the definite article is necessary.
4. The phrase "high level of" refers to the physical levels or floors of an object or structure. Without the preposition "of," the compound adjective "high-level" means top ranking or of great importance. Therefore, the preposition "of" should be removed to convey that the authorities were of high rank.

cleaned: 1. The word "add-on" is misspelled as "add-ons". 2. The word "media" is misspelled as "media of sharing". 3. The word "entertainment" is misspelled as "entertainment add-on".
Label: 1. The sentence is discussing add-ons in general, so "add-on" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  1. The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us . (Incorrect use of preposition) 2. The more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us . (Incorrect use of preposition)
cleaned: 1. The more people using it over us , the more power they will have on us . (Incorrect use of preposition) 2. The more people use it on us , the more power they will have over us . (Incorrect use of preposition)
Label: 1. This sentence is being contrasted with what was said in the previous sentence, so you need to use "however" to indicate their relationship.
2. This sentence is not saying that more people are currently using it, it is a hypothetical statement, and you should therefore use the present tense, "use".
3. Incorrect preposition. Use "on" to indicate the thing (us) that you will perform the action (use) on.
4. If someone is in a position of power or authority, we think of them as being metaphorically above us, therefore if they wield/exert power from that position, then they would be wielding/exerting their power "over" us.

Prediction:  1. The word "to" is missing after "make". 2. The word "from" is missing after "discourages". 3. The word "and" is missing after "design". 4. The word "they" is missing after "have".
cleaned: 1. The word "to" is missing after "make". 2. The word "from" is missing after "discourages". 3. The word "and" is missing after "design". 4. The word "they" is missing after "have".
Label: 1. The preposition "to" refers to directionality, or flowing toward an object, whereas "from" can imply separation or removal from an object. Given this, "discourage from" makes sense because the engineers are stopped from making more effort. The phrase "discourage to" is not grammatically correct, but it would imply something like making a demoralizing remark to someone, which is not the meaning of this sentence.
2. The phrase "for they have" is an archaic way of saying "because they have." If the author wants to say that having little motivation to work hard discourages the engineers from making efforts, then it is understandable, but modern English phrases this as "because they have little motivation to work hard." If the author wants to say that the problem both discourages engineers from making efforts and takes away their motivation to work hard, then the correction is valid.
3. Using the future tense "will" refers to future events, but the rest of this sentence is about ongoing events, so the present tense should be used. It is also clearer and more assertive to say "they have."




Prediction:  1. The word "other" is not needed in the sentence. 2. The word "without" is not needed in the sentence. 3. The word "this" is not needed in the sentence. 4.

cleaned: 1. The word “transfer” is misspelled as “transfered”. 2. The word “spying” is misspelled as “spying”. 3. The word “advertising” is misspelled as “advertising”.
Label: 1. This is the passive voice, continuing from the phrase "is recorded." The passive voice requires a form of the verb "to be" followed by a secondary verb, which is always the past participle. Therefore, it should be changed from the present form "transfer" to the past participle "transferred."

cleaned: 1. The word “with” is missing in the erroneous sentence. 2. The word “their” is missing in the erroneous sentence. 3. The word “to” is missing in the erroneous sentence.
Label: 1. When referring to conversation, the phrases "talk with" and "talk to" are mostly interchangeable, so I'm not sure if I agree with this correction. I agree that it is more common to say "talk to" when the pronoun "each other" is used, but "talk with each other" is not grammatically incorrect. The phrase "talk to" may also have a more general meaning, where "talk with" can have the nuance of consulting with someone, or of a conversation between peers or equals.
2. The verb "face" is an intransitive verb meaning to turn one's body or head toward something. It can be used without an object, and it already indicates the direction without a preposition.

Label: 1. "Happen" is an intransitive verb which does not require the helping verb so "is". The subject "this" is a third person singular, so the verb "happen" requires an "s" or "es." Therefore we change the clause to "this happens."
2. The definite article "the" should not be used because we are discussing multiple unknown countries, not a singular known country. 
3. The author is discussing multiple countries, the noun must be changed from singular "country" to the plural "countries."
4. The be verb "is" must be changed depending on the plurality of the subject. The subject "countries" is plural, and so the be verb "is" must be changed to its appropriate form: "are."
5. "Find" does not need the adverb "back" to convey the implied meaning here. "Find back" is not a common phrase.

Label: 1. The subject here is "parents," which is plural. Because of subject-verb agreement, the appropriate verb form is "have."
2. While the phrase "under risk of" makes logical sense and would be understood, it is not used in English. It's typical to say "at risk of," because the preposition "at" can denote the idea of being in a particular state or condition, such as being exposed to risk.

Label: 1. "Shall" is an old-fashioned way of expressing future tense and is not commonly used in modern English. "Shall" is too formal. "Should" is a more commonly used word to express an opinion. The author believes making RFID available to the public is not beneficial, so "should not" is used. 
2. "For" is used to indicate a purpose or a reason, while "to" is used to indicate the direction or the recipient of an action. In this sentence, the correction is made because the sentence is talking about making powerful devices not easily available to the public, and not for the public.
3. The incorrect sentence uses "and" but the ideas of "not be easily available to the public" and "taken for granted" are two separate predicate phrases not dependent or causal to each other. The author's opinion is that either of these things "should" happen, so the conjunction "or" is more appropriate.




Prediction:  1. In corporate world : Incorrect use of the preposition ‘in’ with the noun ‘corporate world’. The correct preposition is ‘the’. 2. employers often block social media network : Incorrect use of the noun ‘network’ with the verb ‘block’. The correct noun is ‘networks’. 3. to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure : Incorrect use of the verb ‘to prevent’ with the infinitive ‘to spend’. The correct verb is ‘spending’. 4. than concentrating on their work : Incorrect use of the preposition ‘than’ with the verb ‘concentrating’. The correct preposition is ‘than’.

The correct verb is ‘spending’. 4. than concentrating on their work : Incorrect use of the preposition ‘than’ with the verb ‘concentrating’. The correct preposition is ‘than’.
Label: 1. The definite article "the" differentiates the "corporate world" from other worlds, like the fashion world, the music world, the academic world, etc. The definite article is used to refer to a specific thing, so it implies that this world is distinct from other ones.
2. When referencing social media networks as a general concept, the plural "networks" should be used because it references to most or all networks. An employer blocking websites due to productivity concerns will likely block multiple sites, not just one, which is implied by the singular "network."
3. The phrase "prevent from" is a phrasal verb, and the verb is always changed to the gerund after the preposition. Therefore, "spend" should be changed to "spending."

Label: 1. I partially agree with this correction because "of" needs to be removed, but that does not fix the problem. The sentence should be rephrased as "the more time spent on social media sites, the more a person's writing skills will be reduced." First, this construction does not use "of." Second, it always consists of two phrases, and the first is always the cause and the second is always the outcome. Therefore, "time spent on social media" should come first and "writing skills will be reduced" should come second. 
This suggestion also fixes the other grammar issues. First, it is not common to say "time used on social media sites." Instead, it is common to say "time spent on social media sites" or "time spent using social media sites." Second, the phrase "the more of the writing skills" is not commonly used and is different to understand. Also, it is not clear to whom the phrase "writing skills" refers, so it should be changed to "the more a person's writing skills." This makes the meaning clear.
2. When talking about "time spent," English uses the preposition "in" for physical locations and "on" for activities or pursuits. For example, a dedicated scholar might spend a lot of time in the library or spend a lot of time on her studies. Social media is not a physical location, so "on" is appropriate here.

Whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on personal moral morals the nature of how 'directive ' the risk is to them .
Label: 1. An individual's value system consists of multiple elements, so the plural "morals" is correct. The singular "moral" is used mostly to refer to a lesson gleaned from a parable, e.g. "the moral of the story."
2. The concept of "personal morals" is an abstract noun and does not generally require an article. It only uses an article when referring to the values of a specific person, for example, "the personal morals of an individual."




Prediction:  1. " For example " is a preposition and should be followed by a noun. 2. " tend " is a verb and should be followed by a noun. 3. " send " is a verb and should be followed by a noun. 4.

cleaned: 1. The word "real" is missing in the erroneous sentence. 2. The word "thoughts" is misspelled as "thought". 3. The word "personalities" is misspelled as "personality". 4. The word "things" is misspelled as "thing".
Label: 1. The singular noun "thought" refers to a single idea or opinion. For example, "I think I'd like eggs for breakfast" or "She thinks it would be fun to try beekeeping" are two thoughts. But this sentence is referring to a person's worldview, overall thinking, set of values, or general outlook. In this context, "thoughts" should be pluralized.
2. The singular noun "personality" means a collection of traits, behaviors, or emotional qualities that make up an individual's character. The plural noun "personalities" refers to the personalities of multiple people.

2. When referencing relationships as a general concept, the plural "relationships" should be used because it references multiple relationships between many different people. The singular "relationship" is used to refer to individual relationships, with "a relationship" meaning any relationship and "the relationship" meaning one relationship specifically.

cleaned: 1. The word "obvioualy" is misspelled. It should be "obviously". 2. The word "have" is missing. It should be "have been".
Label: 1. This is a spelling error. The correct spelling is "obvious." Also, it looks like the author intended to use the word "obviously," which is an adverb. Adverbs are used to modify verbs, but in this sentence, the word follows "it is" and therefore should be a noun.

cleaned: 1. " but " should be " and " 2. " him or her " should be " him or her " 3. " just " should be " just "
Label: 1. The conjunction "and" is used to introduce new information that adds on to or agrees with a previous idea, while "but" is used to introduce new information that contradicts existing information or subverts expectations.

The use of "but" implies that ignoring people and using Facebook are somehow contradictory.

Explanations: 1. come up with effective policy -> come up with an effective policy 2. stimulate innovation -> stimulate innovation
cleaned: 1. come up with effective policy -> come up with an effective policy 2. stimulate innovation -> stimulate innovation
Label: 1. The noun "policy" requires either an article or pluralization. The definite article "the" refers to a specific policy, especially one that was mentioned earlier in the text. Because no such policy was mentioned, it should be changed to the indefinite article "a," which refers to one single unspecified policy out of multiple potential policies, or alternately to the plural "policies," which means multiple unspecified policies.

Label: 1. The concept of "past decades" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only with the singular "the past decade," meaning the last ten years, or with an adjective like "the past few decades," which refer to specific decades, instead of past decades in general.
2. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "observes" implies that social media sites are still not yet fully developed, so it should be the past tense "were" instead.
3. This sentence is referring to past events, as shown by the phrase "In past decades." The present tense "connect" implies that phone calls and letters are still the default method of communication, so it should be the past tense "connected" instead.

Label: 1. The concept of "face-to-face human contact" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific instances or types of face-to-face contact instead of the concept in general.
2. The noun "contact" can be either countable or uncountable, depending on its meaning. When it means the state in which people communicate with each other, it is uncountable. That is the meaning here, and uncountable nouns cannot be made plural, so it should be "contact" instead.

The word “frequency” is used incorrectly. 5. The word “people” is used incorrectly. 6. The word “addicted” is used incorrectly. 7. The word “sites” is used incorrectly. 8. The word “has” is used incorrectly. 9. The word “been” is used incorrectly. 10. The word “decreasing” is used incorrectly.
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The subject is "research," which is singular, so the verb should be changed to "shows" for subject-verb agreement.

Label: 1. The verb "discriminate" is always used together with "against" when describing treating someone differently or unfairly. The preposition "against" can convey the idea of opposition to the object, indicate who is harmed by an action, or mean that an action is unfavorable to someone. These meanings are consistent with the meaning of "discriminate."

cleaned: 1. The word internet is a noun and should be capitalized. 2. The word real is an adjective and should be followed by a noun. 3. The word life is a noun and should be capitalized.
Label: 1. When used as a noun, "Internet" almost always takes the definite article "the." This may be an idiomatic use, or it may be because everyone who uses the Internet is connected to the same network, no matter where they are.




Prediction:  1. The word “each others” is incorrect. It should be “each other”. 2. The word “as” is incorrect. It should be “in”. 3. The word “even” is incorrect. It should be “an”. 4. The word “more” is incorrect. It should be “important”.
cleaned: 1. The word “each others” is incorrect. It should be “each other”. 2. The word “as” is incorrect. It should be “in”. 3. The word “even” is incorrect. It should be “an”. 4. The word “more” is incorrect. It should be “important”.
Label: 1. "Each" needs to be followed by a singular noun, because use of "each" in this case means that you are talking about every person separately, so use "other" here.
2. Incorrect word choice. You could say "it is an important aspect", but in your sentence you are using the verb "play" which "aspect" does not fit with. The word that fits with "play" and the rest of the sentence is "role", as something can "play an important role in our lives".

Label: 1. An "s" and a space are missing. There should be an "s" after the apostrophe and "view" should be a separate word.




Prediction:  1. The word “length” is misspelled as “lengths”. 2. The word “as” is misspelled as “as”. 3. The word “they” is misspelled as “their”.
cleaned: 1. The word “length” is misspelled as “lengths”. 2. The word “as” is misspelled as “as”. 3. The word “they” is misspelled as “their”.
Label: 1. This is a fairly common expression, which can also be expressed as "go to any length". Both versions imply that people will do anything to achieve a particular goal, in this case, "make their words as short as they can", and as that means there are many things that they might try, "lengths" should be pluralised to reflect this.
2. Incorrect word form. In this part of the sentence it is saying how "short" the words are (as short as possible), and so it doesn't make sense to say "shorter" here, in the same way as you can ask "How short is this?" but you can't ask "How shorter is this?".

Prediction:  1. The word “case” is not appropriate here. It should be replaced by “circumstance”. 2. The word “results” is not appropriate here. It should be replaced by “leads to”. 3. The word “invention” is not appropriate here. It should be replaced by “discovery”.

Label: 1. I agree with this correction partially. There is no issue with either "accidental" or "unintentional" so that edit is a stylistic one. As for the rest, firstly, the structure "under an accidental case" is not commonly used. A clearer way of describing such a discovery is "making an accidental discovery." Secondly, the phrase "Serendipity is usually defined as making an accidental discovery" is grammatically correct, but that doesn't sound like a definition. Phrases like "a phenomenon of" are frequently used to make definitions match the part of speech of the word being defined. Since "serendipity" is a noun, its definition is easier to understand if it begins with a noun, like "phenomenon," instead of a gerund like "making."
2. The verb "result" needs the preposition "in" to indicate the outcome or result of the action.

"As the result" means that this is the only possible outcome of a given situation. If there are multiple possible outcomes, it should be "as a result," which implies that the outcome is one of several.

Label: 1. Unnecessary word. "That" and "with" are both prepositions that can follow "argue", but you can only use one. "With" should be used when indicating who you are arguing against, as in "he is arguing with his brother", but "argue" is being used in this sentence to say that the critics would assert the opinion that they have on the subject, so you need to use "that" to indicate the opinion.
2. Incorrect conjugation. "Social media sites" is just being used to modify "existence", so use the third person singular to go with "existence".

Label: 1. This is a common phrase. When it is singular, there is always an article. It is usually "there is a need," but sometimes "there is the need," referring to a specific need that has already been mentioned in the text or that is being compared to another need. There is no article in the plural "there are needs," but otherwise an article is always used.

Label: 1. The adjective "lesser" means smaller in size and quality, while "less" is used to compare the quantity or degree of something. The subject here is "five percent," which is a number/quantity, so "lesser" should be changed to "less."
2. China is a proper noun, and most proper nouns do not take the definite article "the." This is because the function of "the" is to indicate that a noun is one specific thing, which is unnecessary with proper nouns because they are specific by nature.

The word “carrying” is used in the wrong tense. It should be “carry”. 4. The word “certain” is used in the wrong tense. It should be “certainly”.
Label: 1. Incorrect preposition. "To" would indicate an aspiration or opportunity, as in "I hope I have the chance to see Big Ben when I'm in London". As "chance" here is a possibility, it should be followed by the preposition "of".
2. "Carry" is the present tense, but seeing as we are talking about a potential future, the present continuous, "carrying", should be used.

cleaned: 1. It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others . 2. It provides people with a more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others .
Label: 1. The indefinite article "a" is used when something exists in an unspecified manner or amount, or to express one out of multiple options.

Label: 1. The verb "discuss" does not take the preposition "about." While "about" is used with similar verbs like "tell" or "talk," in the case of "discuss," the object simply comes directly after, with no need for a preposition.
2. The concept of "contemporary society" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to a specific contemporary society instead of the general concept.




Prediction:  1. The word "invading" is incorrect. The correct word is "safeguarding". 2. The word "in" is incorrect. The correct word is "of". 3. The word "us" is incorrect. The correct word is "us". 4. The word "and" is incorrect. The correct word is "or".

cleaned: 1. Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary . 2. Some genes will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary .
Label: 1. The adjective "genetic" means of or relating to genes, so "genetic genes" is redundant and "genetic" should be deleted.
2. The word "some" means an unspecified amount or a large amount. It is usually used with plural nouns. Also, it is unlikely that there is only one gene that can only be inherited by a specific gender, so logically it is more likely to be the plural.

Label: 1. The subject here is the plural "people," so for subject-verb agreement's sake, the verb form should be "say."

Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "passed" implies that the author's perspective is in the past, but this sentence is about events in the present. Therefore, the present tense "passes" should be used.

Label: 1. Having a presence on a social media platform is referred to as being "on" social media. This is a collocation, or it may be because "on" can refer to a state of connection, such as in "on the Internet" or "on the phone."
2. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general.
3. When referencing images as a general concept, the plural "images" should be used because it references all or any images. The singular "image" is used to refer to an individual image, with "an image" meaning any image and "the image" meaning one specific image. Also, in this sentence, the images are posted by "people," which is plural, so even if each person only posts one image, it still constitutes multiple images.
4. The concept of "social media" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific social media sites, instead of such sites in general. Also, the concept of posts on pages is derived from bulletin boards, where people would post flyers and notices. This used the preposition "on" because papers would be attached to the face of the bulletin board.
5. The phrase "may not have" already has one auxiliary verb: "may." It is incorrect and redundant to have two auxiliary verbs in a row, so "do" should be deleted. Also, the subject "he or she" is singular, so "jobs" should be changed to "a job" so that the statement refers to one person.

cleaned: 1. I am study in oversea -> I am studying oversea 2. contact my old friend -> contact my old friends
Label: 1. This is using the present continuous tense, which is made up of the verb "to be" plus a gerund. It means that something is currently occurring or in progress. This construction cannot use the bare infinitive "study," so it should be changed to "studying."
2. The adverb "overseas" already implies the idea of being in a foreign country or location, as "over seas" means "across the sea." It does not need a preposition.
3. When referencing friendships as a general concept, the plural "friends" should be used because it references multiple people. The singular "friend" is used to refer to an individual friend, with "a friend" meaning any friend and "the friend" meaning one specific friend.




Prediction:  1. The word "Human" should be "Humans" because it is plural. 2. The word "their" should be "have" because it is singular. 3. The word "privacy" should be "privacy" because it is singular.

Label: 1. The sentence is discussing people in general, so "human" should be pluralised.
2. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "have" to go with "humans".

Label: 1. Missing article. "Internet" is the name of a specific network, so use the definite article, "the".
2. The sentence starts with "He", referring to man, but the third person possessive you have used is the female version. Change to "his" to match with "He" and make it clear that you are talking about a man.

Prediction:  1. claimed is the past tense of claim. 2. through is a preposition. 3. regardless is an adverb.
cleaned: 1. claimed is the past tense of claim. 2. through is a preposition. 3. regardless is an adverb.
Label: 1. The past tense refers to actions or states that were completed in the past, while the present tense refers to actions or states that are currently ongoing or occur often. The past tense "claimed" implies that teenagers no longer say this, which is contradicted by the use of "today." Since it is referring to a current condition, it should be the present tense "claim" instead.

2. The sentence is discussing smartphone applications in general, so "application" should be pluralised.
3. We don't literally take an app and put it inside our phones, we install it on the hard drive/memory, which is usually a flat object, so we use "on".

Label: 1. In the part of the sentence where you have written "spend too much time on the internet", "spend" is functioning as a noun, so add -ing to it to make it function as a noun.
2. When we talk about the internet, we use the definite article, i.e. "the internet", because we are referring to a specific network.

Label: 1. The definite article “the” can imply a comparison. The phrase “the engineering process” implies the existence of other processes, such as the development process or the design process, and marks “the engineering process” as being distinct from those other processes.
2. The verb "fuse" means to combine or to join together. Its meaning and its connection to the engineering design process are unclear, so it should be deleted.
3. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem. As a noun, "current" means electrical or water currents, or an idea that is shared by a group. It cannot be used alone to mean "the current process." I think the author intended to write "the current one," meaning "the current process," but made a spelling error. The correct way to fix this is to change "on" to "one."
4. I don't agree with this correction because it does not fix the problem and it creates a grammatically unsound sentence. The verb "cater to" requires an object, which here is "desired deeds." Removing the object destroys the meaning of the whole phrase. While it's true that the meaning of the phrase "desired deeds" is unclear, it cannot be removed entirely and so it should be changed to something like "what others desire."




Prediction:  1. They should be replaced by them. 2. Not should be replaced by put. 3. Their should be replaced by their. 4. In should be replaced by on.
cleaned: 1. They should be replaced by them. 2. Not should be replaced by put. 3. Their should be replaced by their. 4. In should be replaced by on.
Label: 1. The phrase "put in danger" is a common expression and the verb does not change. The verb "put" means to cause someone to be in a particular place or position.

Label: 1. This sentence uses the noun "cause," meaning a person or thing that gives rise to something. In such cases, "cause" takes the pronoun "of," which is used to indicate what caused an event. Therefore, the phrase "the main cause of global warming" means "the main thing that causes global warming."
2. The subject here is "global warming," which is singular, so the verb should be "gives" for subject-verb agreement.

The word “of” is missing in the erroneous sentence. 8. The word “their” is missing in the erroneous sentence.
Label: 1. The article "a" is used before a word starting with a consonant that makes a consonant sound. The article "an" is used before a word starting with a vowel that makes a vowel sound. "Unhealthy" begins with the vowel "u", and it is pronounced as a vowel, so you should use "an" before it.
2. "End" here is a noun that goes with "cause", and it requires an article before it in the same way as "cause the death". As a marriage can only have one end, this is a specific noun that is being referred to, so you should use "the".




Prediction:  1. The word "in" is missing after "situation". 2. The word "from" is missing after "protect". 3. The word "particularly" is missing before "small". 4. The word "who" is missing after "small". 5. The word "are" is missing after "studying".

Label: 1. Add a comma to separate the clauses.
2. "In particularly for" does not make sense, it is correct here to use "particularly" on its own.
3. This sentence is talking about small children in general and therefore it does not need an article.




Prediction:  1. The word "which" is used to introduce a relative clause. The relative clause is a clause that modifies a noun or a pronoun. In this case, the relative clause is modifying the noun "design processes". The relative clause is introduced by the relative pronoun "which". The relative pronoun "which" is used to introduce a non-restrictive relative clause. A non-restrictive relative clause provides additional information about the noun or pronoun that it modifies. In this case, the relative clause is providing additional information about the noun "design processes". The relative clause is not essential to the meaning of the sentence, so it is not necessary to use the relative pronoun "which". Instead, the relative clause can be introduced by the relative pronoun "that". The relative pronoun "that" is used to introduce a restrictive relative clause. A restrictive relative clause is a clause that restricts the meaning of the noun or pronoun that it modifies. In this case, the relative clause is restricting the meaning of the noun "design processes". The relative clause is essential to the meaning of the sentence, so it is necessary to use the relative pronoun "that". The correct sentence is: According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,

Label: 1. A comma is always needed before a non-restrictive clause. A non-restrictive clause is a clause that adds additional information to the sentence and that can be removed. The phrase "According to... design processes," is a full sentence on its own, making the phrase "which are... implementing it" a non-restrictive clause, so it requires a comma.

cleaned: 1. The word "the" is missing before "face-to-face human contact". 2. The word "has" is missing before "decresed".

2. When used in the context of "face-to-face human contact", "contact" is an uncountable noun and therefore should not have an "s" at the end.




Prediction:  1. The word "a" is not needed before "research". 2. The word "it" is not needed before "has been proven". 3. The word "the" is not needed before "users". 4.

The word "their" is not needed before "lives". 8. The word "people" is not needed before "lives".
Label: 1. "Research" is an uncountable noun, so it does not take the indefinite article "a." To refer to one specific study, it is common to say "according to a research study" or "according to research by [author/institution]," but for research-based knowledge in general, the phrase is "according to research."
2. The concept of "users" is a general concept and can be assumed to be understood by the reader. It takes the definite article only when referring to specific groups of users instead of to users in general.
3. Names of websites are proper nouns and therefore do not take an article in general. As an exception, organizational names that contain "Group," "Association," or similar words often have "the" added when used in a sentence, like "the American Medical Association" or "the Sony Group." But outside of these special cases, there should be no article.

Label: 1. "But" should be used in the situation where you do one thing, but not the other, so you could say, "they don't speak to the people around them, but do communicate with friends on Facebook," but in the context of your sentence, you are saying that both these actions are going on at the same time, so you should use "and", as in they shun/ignore the people around them AND only communicate with friends on Facebook.

cleaned: 1. having dinners -> having dinner 2. without any chatting -> without chatting 3. because their holding -> because they are holding 4. one hand when the other hand -> one hand while the other hand 5. holding a fork -> holding a fork in their hand
Label: 1. The plural "dinners" refers either to each family member's individual orders at the restaurant or to multiple instances of gathering for dinner. A meal is still referred to in the singular when it is shared by multiple people. Therefore, it should be "having dinner" rather than "having dinners."




Prediction:  1. The word dilemma is plural, so it should be dilemmas . 2. The word dilemma is a noun, so it should be dilemmas .

Prediction:  1. The word “time” is missing in the erroneous sentence. 2. The word “times” is missing in the erroneous sentence. 3. The word “times” is misspelled as “time” in the erroneous sentence.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.

The word “will” is used incorrectly. It should be “would” instead. 4. The word “badly” is used incorrectly. It should be “badly affected” instead.
Label: 1. Unnecessary word. You would use "on" with "spend" if it was going with a noun, as in "You need to spend more time on your essay", but when it is used with a verb, as is the case here with "chatting", you do not need to use "on".
2. This sentence is talking about interpersonal skills in general, so "skill" should be pluralised.




Prediction:  1. The children rely the parent to live. 2. The children rely on the parents to live.
You are given an erroneous input sentence and its correction. Output a simple explanation for each error in the erroneous sentence.
Erroneous sentence: The children rely the parent to live .
Correct sentence: The children rely on the parents to live .
Explanations: 1. The children rely the parent to live. 2. The children rely on the parents to live.
cleaned: 1. The children rely the parent to live. 2. The children rely on the parents to live.
Label: 1. The verb "rely" always uses the preposition "on" or "upon." It is a collocation, and it reflects the relationship of dependence. If A relies on B, then figuratively, A is supported by or resting on B.
2. The subject is "children," which is plural. Because the statement refers to multiple children, it involves multiple parents, so "parents" should be plural too.

Label: 1. The definite article "the" refers to a specific thing, so "the burden" implies that every family has one specific burden. The phrase "a burden," with the indefinite article "a," implies that the carrier does not want to cause any burden to her family due to her condition. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say "a burden."




Prediction:  1. The word "on" is not used in this context. 2. The word "years" is not used in this context.
cleaned: 1. The word "on" is not used in this context. 2. The word "years" is not used in this context.
Label: 1. Incorrect word choice. When talking about reading something, you would say "read on" when the information is all contained on a single page, like with a menu, but with a newspaper/book/magazine/etc. that you can actually open up and look inside at the information on different pages, you would say "read in". Although the verb in this sentence is "notice", not "read", the concept remains the same, so use "in".

Label: 1. I agree that "if" needs to be corrected, but have additional edits. First, in the original sentence, the engineer needs to answer two questions: (1) which method is suitable, and (2) if that method is legal. The latter is a choice between two options: if it agrees with existing laws or if it does not. This type choice is better expressed as "whether," which can indicate different choices or possibilities. Therefore, "if" should be changed to whether.

Erroneous sentence: When people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us .
Correct sentence: When people around us know that we got a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , whether caring for us too much or keeping away from us .
Explanations: 1. got certain disease -> a certain disease
cleaned: 1. got certain disease -> a certain disease 2. altitudes -> attitudes 3. caring us -> caring for us
Label: 1. The combination of "certain" and a noun requires either the indefinite article "a" or the plural form. Though there may be cases where someone is diagnosed with multiple diseases at the same time, it is more common to assume a single disease, hence the indefinite article.
2. The word "altitude" means height, especially in relation to ground or sea level. The correct word here is "attitude," meaning a way of thinking or feeling.
3. The verb "care" requires the preposition "for" in order to connect to the object, or the person receiving the care.

It has two independent clauses joined by a comma. The first independent clause is 'we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status '.

Prediction:  1. The word "for" is missing after "another year" . 2. The word "the" is missing before "top" . 3. The word "student" is missing after "top" . 4. The word "in" is missing after "province" .
cleaned: 1. The word "for" is missing after "another year" . 2. The word "the" is missing before "top" . 3. The word "student" is missing after "top" . 4. The word "in" is missing after "province" .
Label: 1. The phrase "stay another year" is used in spoken English and casual contexts, but in formal writing, the grammatically correct phrase "stay for another year" should be used. The preposition "for" is used to indicate an amount of time or space, in this case, one more year.
2. With the definite article "the," the phrase "the secondary school" refers to a specific secondary school. "Secondary school" with no article means secondary school in a less specific sense. The meaning of this sentence is not that the student was asked to remain at a specific secondary school for another year, but to remain a secondary school student for another year, so the more general "secondary school" is a better choice.
3. The phrase "the top student" is a common phrase meaning "the number-one student." The adjective "top" means highest in rank. Combined with the definite article "the," which refers to one specific thing, it can only mean the number-one performing student in his province. The number is redundant and ungrammatical, so it should be removed.

3. This sentence is talking about negative effects in general, so "effect" should be pluralised.

cleaned: 1. The word “almost” is misspelled as “almost immediate”. 2. The word “to” is missing after “immediately”. 3. The word “the” is missing before “people”.
Label: 1. Incorrect form. "Immediate" is an adjective, so it needs to go with an adjective, but in this sentence it is being used with the verb disseminate, so you need to use the adverb form, "immediately". Consider the following rearranged and simplified sentence: "Social media is powerful as a tool as it can almost immediately disseminate information to people".

3. Incorrect conjugation. Use the third person plural "live" to go with "humans".
4. "Aid" used in the sense of help or assistance is an uncountable noun and therefore should not be pluralised.

cleaned: 1. The word "thousand" is misspelled as "thousand". 2. The word "helps" is misspelled as "help". 3. The word "understanding" is misspelled as "understanding".
Label: 1. This sentence is not using "thousand" as a specific number, i.e. 1,000, it is using it metaphorically to express a large, unspecified amount. In this case, it should be pluralised as "thousands".
2. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
3. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.
4. This is an uncountable noun and should therefore not be pluralised.

Label: 1. The verb "create" means to bring something into existence, so "to create a material" means to develop a material that does not exist yet. The intended meaning of this sentence is not to develop a new material but to construct buildings with a better material, so the verb "use" should be used instead.
2. The indefinite article "a" refers to one thing, so the phrase "create a better material" to create one material, but this sentence is about material in general. In this case, it is common to say "create better material," in which "material" is an uncountable noun meaning matter from which something is made, or "create better materials," in which "materials" can refer to various building materials.
3. "Building" is a general concept that should be familiar to the reader, so it does not take the definite article "the" when referred to in a general sense. "The" is used with "buildings" in order to draw a distinction or a comparison between different buildings, but not in a general statement like this.
4. "Despite" means in spite of or not being affected by something. "During" means throughout the duration of an event. This sentence isn't referring to materials that can support a building in spite of the occurrence of disasters, but materials that allow a building to withstand disasters by providing support throughout the duration of a disaster. Therefore, "during" should be used instead.
5. When referencing natural disasters in general, the plural "disasters" should be used because it is a category that refers to earthquakes, typhoons, and multiple other things. The singular "disaster" is used to refer to an individual disaster, with "a disaster" meaning any disaster and "the disaster" meaning one specific disaster.

cleaned: 1. The word “device” is plural, so it should be “devices”. 2. The word “until” is used to indicate a time period, so it should be “until we did not realize the importance of writing”.
Label: 1. Auto-correct is a feature that is common to many different electronic devices, so the plural "devices" should be used. The singular "device" is used to refer to individual devices, with "a device" meaning any device and "the device" meaning one specific device.
